'''Juan Peregrino Anselmo''' (30 April 1902 – 27 October 1975) was a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for [[Uruguay]] who was a member of the champion squad at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], as he scored 3 goals in the tournament, including 2 in the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-499059/The-forgotten-heroes-66-World-Cup-medals-last.html |title=The forgotten heroes of '66 get World Cup medals at last &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first false 9 in a world cup. He also won the gold medal with Uruguay at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]].

Peñarol]]. As coach, succeeding mid-1962 the Hungarian [[Béla Guttmann]] in office, he led the club to the Uruguayan championship of the same year. In the later part of 1963 the Uruguayan goalkeeper [[Roque Maspoli]] succeeded him.

'''Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Auld''' (January 26, 1900 in [[Stevenston]], [[North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]] – December 6, 1977 in [[Johnston, Rhode Island]]) was a [[Scottish American]] [[soccer]] player who spent most of his professional career in the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] as a [[midfielder]] and [[Striker (association football)|forward]]. He earned five [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]], three coming in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. He was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

==Early career==
Auld began his organized soccer career with Scottish club Stevenston F.C. in 1911, when he was eleven years old. He stayed with the club for three years, until he entered the military in 1913. His service continued through [[World War I]] and Auld was not discharged until 1919. When he left the military, he joined [[Ardeer Thistle F.C.|Ardeer Thistle]] in 1919. He remained with the club for three years, until he moved to [[Glasgow]] club [[Parkhead F.C.]] in 1921. In 1923, he immigrated to the [[United States]] to live in [[Gillespie, Illinois]]. Life in the U.S. did not suit Auld and he decided to return to Scotland; however, he stopped en route to visit his sister who lived in [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. While there, he played a game of pick-up soccer. During the game, a scout for the [[Providence Gold Bugs|Providence Clam Diggers]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] (ASL) saw him and after the game convinced Auld to sign with the Diggers. At the time, the ASL was one of the highest paying and most competitive soccer leagues in the world. Team owners used these qualities to draw many of the top European, especially English and Scottish, players to the U.S.

==American Soccer League==
Auld would spend six seasons with Providence, playing 277 games with them. In 1928, the club renamed itself the Gold Bugs.  Then in 1930, a consortium of businessmen in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] bought the club and moved it to that city, renaming the team [[Fall River F.C.]]. Auld played ten games during the spring 1931 season with Fall River before moving to the [[Pawtucket Rangers]] for the remaining eight games of the spring 1931 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jose | first = Colin | title = American Soccer League, 1921-1931 | type = Hardback | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1998 | id = (ISBN 0-8108-3429-4) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the first American Soccer League finally collapsed in 1933, the Rangers moved to the New England Division of the second American Soccer League for the 1933-1934 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1934.html 1934 U.S. soccer history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, he joined [[Newark Portuguese]], a semi-professional team. However, he spent only two years with the club and retired from playing in 1935.

==National team==
While Auld had an excellent professional career, he is best known as a member of the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] which took third place at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. Auld earned his first cap with the national team in a November 6, 1926 6-1 dismantling of [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]. Auld scored two goals, his only two with the national team, in his debut game. Auld did not play again with the U.S. until the first game of the World Cup. He then played the next two matches as the U.S. went to the semifinals only to fall to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a particularly physical game. Several U.S. players were injured and the team finished with only eight fit field players. Auld himself was kicked in the mouth in the first half. According to the U.S. coach, [[Wilfred Cummings]], the Argentinians scored their third goal “only after Andy Auld had his lip ripped wide open and one of the players from across the La Platte River had knocked the smelling salts out of Trainer Coll's hand and into Andy's eyes, temporarily blinding one of the outstanding 'little stars' of the World's Series.&quot; As substitutes were not permitted at the time, Auld played the rest of the game with a rag stuffed in his mouth to stem the bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://national.soccerhall.org/Spotlight%20HallofFamer/JockColl_spotlight.htm Hall of Famer Spotlight ... John Coll&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the tournament, the U.S. traveled to Brazil where Auld and his team mates lost 4-3. That was his last game with the national team.

After retiring from playing professionally, Auld made his living in the sheet metal business. He died in [[Rhode Island]] on December 6, 1977. In 1986, he was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]].

Near the end of his football career, Benítez also played for Argentinian sides [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] (1939–41) and [[Ferro Carril Oeste]] (1941–44). During his time at Racing he became the top scorer in the [[Primera División Argentina topscorers|Primera División Argentina]] and in South American football for 1940 with 33 goals, tied with [[Isidro Lángara]] of [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]].

He earned 15 caps for Paraguay, including his participation at the [[1929 South American Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsssf.com/tables/29safull.html&lt;/ref&gt; and both of the team's matches at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]] against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]; he scored three goals for Paraguay. Later, he appeared once for the [[Argentina national football team]] in 1934, scoring one goal.

After retiring from football as a player, he became a coach and led [[Independiente Medellín]] to a [[Colombia]]n national championship in 1955. He also managed Sporting de Barranquilla, [[Boca Juniors de Cali]] and [[Millonarios Fútbol Club|Millonarios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=GolGolGol Futbol|author=Ruiz M., Juan Guillermo|title=Un día como hoy en el fútbol: Enero 8|trans_title=On this day in football: January 8|url=http://colombia.golgolgol.net/movil/un-dia-como-hoy-en-el-futbol-enero-8_1048-120236.html|date=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also coached several [[Venezuela]]n football teams.

'''Michael “Mike” Bookie''' (September 12, 1904 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] – October 12, 1944 at [[Camp Eglin]], [[Florida]]) was a U.S. [[soccer]] [[Striker (association football)|forward]].  He was a member of the U.S. team at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] and is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]].

==Professional career==
Bookie began his athletic career as a minor league baseball player playing shortstop in Pittsburgh.  He then joined several amateur soccer clubs, including [[Jeannette F.C.]] in western Pennsylvania before signing with the [[Boston Wonder Workers]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] in 1924.  In January 1925, he moved to [[Vestaburg SC]] where he finished out the season.  In the fall of 1925, returned to the ASL, this time with the [[New Bedford Whalers]]. He saw time in only four games with the Whalers.  From February through April 1927, he played for American Hungarian.  In December 1929, he moved to Cleveland Slavia of the Mid-West Professional League.  Bookie was with Slavia when selected to the U.S. 1930 World Cup team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://national.soccerhall.org/early%20world%20cup.htm National Soccer Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1931, he left Cleveland Slavia.  He may have played for other Cleveland teams before finishing his career with Pittsburgh Curry Silver Tops.

==National team==
While selected to the U.S. roster for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], Bookie never entered a game in the cup.  After [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] eliminated the U.S. in the semifinals, the U.S. went on a tour of Uruguay and Brazil.  In the only official international game of the tour, Bookie earned his only [[United States men's national soccer team|national team]] [[cap (sports)|cap]] in a 4-3 loss to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det69.html USA - Details of International Matches 1885-1969] at www.rsssf.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

'''James &quot;Jim&quot; Brown''' (December 31, 1908{{spaced ndash}}November 9, 1994) was a [[Scottish American]] [[association football]] player who played for the [[United States men's national soccer team]] at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], scoring the only goal of the American team in their 6-1 semi-final loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. He began his career in the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] before moving to England and then Scotland. After retiring from playing, he coached at the youth, senior amateur, and professional levels. He was inducted into the U.S. [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

== Youth ==
While born in [[Kilmarnock]], Brown grew up in [[Troon]], the oldest of four brothers, two who played professionally as [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]]. His brother, [[John Brown (footballer born 1915)|Jock]] also earned a [[cap (sports)|cap]] with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], while youngest brother [[Tom Brown (footballer born 1919)|Tom]] player professionally in [[England]]. Brown became an apprentice [[riveter]] at the Troon Shipyard when he was 13. At some point, his father deserted the family and moved to the [[United States]]. In 1927, Brown left Scotland to search for his father, settling in [[Westfield, New Jersey]] and finding work as a riveter in a factory.

== Amateur career ==
Brown never played organized football in [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]] as a youth. When he arrived in the United States, he joined the Bayonne Rovers, a local amateur team in 1927. In 1928, he signed as an amateur with the [[Newark Skeeters]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]]. However, the league suspended the Skeeters in September 1928 as part of the &quot;[[History of soccer in the United States#Soccer Wars|Soccer War]]&quot;. Newark then joined two other suspended ASL teams and several others from the Southern New York Soccer Association to form the [[Eastern Professional Soccer League]]. Brown played seven games with Newark in the ASL and an unknown number in the EPSL, or ESL as it was better known. However, at the end of the season, he returned to the ASL when he signed with the [[New York Nationals (ASL)|New York Nationals]].

==National team==
In 1930, Brown was called up to the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S.national team]] as it prepared for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  At the time, national team requirements were less stringent and Brown was selected based on his father’s, not his own, citizenship.  Brown played all three U.S. games in the cup as the team went to the semifinals, scoring the only goal for the US in the 89th minute.  Following their elimination, the U.S. played a series of exhibition games throughout South America against professional and regional teams in Uruguay and Brazil.  Brown scored one goal in the last exhibition game against Botafogo F.C. in Brazil. Only one, a 4–3 loss to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] counted as a full international. That was Brown’s last of his four [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the U.S. national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det69.html |title=USA - Details of International Matches 1885-1969 |last=Courtney |first=Barrie |date=29 June 2003 |work=[[RSSSF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===United States===
In 1930, Brown became a professional with the [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]]. Soon after, he was called into the U.S. national team for the 1930 World Cup. On his return from Uruguay, he rejoined his team, now under new ownership and known as the [[New York Soccer Club]]. He played the fall 1930 season with New York S.C. then moved to the [[Brooklyn Wanderers]] for the 1931 spring season. Brown moved to the [[Newark Americans]] for the fall 1931 season, but by this time the ASL was collapsing. Therefore, he decided to return to Scotland in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jose&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jose |first1=Colin |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=American Soccer League, 1921-1931: The Golden Years of American Soccer.&amp;nbsp; |url= |type=Hardback |accessdate= |edition= |series=American Sports History Series #9.&amp;nbsp; |volume= |date= |year=1998 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Scarecrow Press.&amp;nbsp; |location= |language= |isbn=0-8108-3429-4 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=544.&amp;nbsp; |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''England'''

Based on his success in the U.S. both professionally and with the national team, several teams from both England and Scotland expressed an interest in signing Brown.  As the ship he was on neared the dock, representatives from these teams awaited him.  However, Scott Duncan, manager of [[Manchester United]], took a tugboat out to the liner and signed Brown on board.  Brown played from 1932 to 1934 with United, scoring seventeen goals in forty games, second highest on the team.  Notably, he scored directly from a free kick in his first game with them. While Brown scored regularly with United, he alienated the team management with his outspoken support for a players’ union.  In May 1935, United transferred Brown to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], but his union activities quickly soured his relationship with the team ownership.  He made only one appearance for the first team,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brentfordfchistory.co.uk/player.php?id=90 Brentford Football Club History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but scored 53 goals in 73 games for the [[Brentford Reserves|reserves]] and won the 1934/35 [[London Challenge Cup]] with the side.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Haynes |first=Graham |date=1998 |title=A-Z Of Bees: Brentford Encyclopaedia |url= |location= |publisher=Yore Publications |isbn=1 874427 57 7 |accessdate= |page = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 1936, Brentford sent Brown to [[Tottenham Hotspur]].  In his one season there, he played only four first team games, but scored twenty-one goals in thirty games for the reserves.  In July of 1937, Brown moved to the semi-professional [[Guildford City F.C.|Guildford City]] of the [[Southern Football League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bees&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = |first = |year = 1995|title = Brentford F.C. Griffin Gazette versus Cambridge United 28/01/95|url = |location = |publisher = Quay Design of Poole|page = 26|isbn = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over his two seasons with Guildford City, Brown scored 148 goals in 150 games and helped the club win the Southern League title during the [[1937–38 Southern Football League|1937-38]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;bees&quot; /&gt; During the 1938-'39 season, Brown recorded 5 Hat-Tricks and scored 7 goals (6 of them headers) in one Game Vs Exeter City. He then moved north to finish his career with Scottish First Division club [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], where he played in at least one game with his brother John against Queen's Park. Just like his debut with Manchester United, he scored directly from a corner kick. He retired due to injuries soon after.

==Coaching career==
In 1948, he returned to the United States where he became the head coach of the [[Greenwich High School]] soccer team.  Two years later, he joined several other men in forming the Connecticut State Amateur League as well as Greenport United. When his son, [[George Brown (soccer)|George]] began playing for Greenport, Brown joined him for two seasons as a player-coach.  He then coached the [[Brunswick School (Connecticut)|Brunswick School]] soccer team for twenty-two years and the [[Elizabeth Falcons]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] from 1956 to 1958. Brown was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986 and the Connecticut State Hall of Fame in 2000. His son [[George Brown (soccer)|George]] was inducted in 1995.

== Personal life ==
Having retired from playing professionally in 1939, Brown resumed his trade as a riveter in the Troon Shipyard.

'''Héctor Castro''' (29 November 1904 – 15 September 1960) was a [[Football in Uruguay|Uruguay]]an [[association football|football]] player and coach.

==Early life==
Castro was born in [[Montevideo]]. When he was 13, he accidentally amputated his right-forearm while using an electric saw, which gave origin to his nickname, ''El manco'' (meaning &quot;the one-armed&quot;, or &quot;the maimed&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;translation_of_el_manco&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url   = http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manco#Spanish| title = Manco – Wiktionary}} Retrieved on 30 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/fact/q_a_h_ctor_castro_1930s_disabled_football_star.shtml|title=Ouch Q&amp;A: Héctor Castro 1930s disabled football star|last=Peck|first=Sunil|date=7 June 2006|work=Ouch!|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==

===Club career===
Castro began his career in 1923/24 with [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] and was the first player to score in a World Cup game for [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. At Nacional he won three [[Primera División Uruguaya|Uruguayan Championships]] (1924, 1933, 1934), before retiring in 1936.

====1933 Uruguayan Championship====
In the 1933 Uruguayan Championship, [[Club Atlético Peñarol|Peñarol]] player Braulio Castro scored a controversial goal in the championship match where the ball clearly went out of play, but rebounded off a [[kinesiology|kinesiologist's]] medicine cabinet back into play in the build-up to the goal. This turned out to be the only goal of the game, and the opposition, [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], felt very hard done by, and three of their players were [[Penalty_card#Red_card|sent off]], for assaulting the referee in annoyance at the goal. This meant that the referee, [[Telésforo Rodríguez]], was unable to continue through injury, so one of the [[linesmen|assistant referees]], [[Luis Scandroglio]], stepped in, and immediately abandoned the match due to bad light, after seventy minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url   = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/uru33.html| title = Uruguay 1933 Championship
|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over two months later, on 30 July, the League Board decided to disallow the goal, and also rescinded one of the three aforementioned sendings-off (that of [[Ulises Chifflet]]). They also ruled that the final twenty minutes would be played at [[Estadio Centenario]], but behind closed doors to try to avoid the same controversy which had plagued the original encounter. The match went ahead behind closed doors, and there were no goals in the twenty minutes. In a highly unorthodox move, two sessions of extra-time were played (the usual allowance would be a single session), the score remained goalless.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot; /&gt; [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]]'s fans remember this game as the &quot;9 contra 11&quot; (&quot;9 against 11&quot;) since their team played the remaining 20 minutes plus both overtimes (totalling over 80 minutes) with nine players.


A second playoff, which consisted of a standard match, followed once again by two sessions of extra-time, was played on 2 September, but still the deadlock wasn't broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot; /&gt;

A third playoff was contested on 18 November, and Héctor Castro played a vital role in this match, scoring a hat-trick which meant twice equalising as well as scoring the winning goal for [[Nacional Montevideo|Nacional]], in a 3–2 win over [[Peñarol]], which finally settled the Uruguayan Championship, almost six months after the controversial first playoff. This controversial playoff also meant that the Uruguayan Championship of 1933 was bizarrely not awarded until November 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot; /&gt;

===International career===
Castro made his debut for the [[Uruguay national football team]] in November 1923. He played his final match for ''la Celeste'' in August 1935 having played 25 times, scoring 18 goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/uru-recintlp.html|title=Appearances for Uruguay National Team|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1928 Olympics====
Playing for Uruguay at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]] Castro won a gold medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=47398/index.html|title=FIFA Player Statistics: Hector Castro|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930 FIFA World Cup====
Castro's goal in the World Cup Final helped Uruguay win the first [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[FIFA World Cup 1930|1930]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa1&quot; /&gt; He also scored the first ever goal at Estadio Centenario, against Perú in that tournament.

====South American Championship====
Castro played in [[Copa América|South American Championship]]-winning teams in [[1926 South American Championship|1926]] and [[1935 South American Championship|1935]].

'''Augustin Chantrel''' (November 11, 1906 – September 4, 1956)&lt;ref&gt;Birth date given according to the source ''[http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/chantrelaugustin/ Fussballdaten.de]''&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[France|French]] former [[football (soccer)]] [[Formation (association football)#2–3–5 (Pyramid)|halfback]]. He played for several local clubs and at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]] and an Olympian.

==Early life and career==
During his youth, Chantrel played for the ''Paris Université Club'' (PUC), until [[Paris]] team [[Red Star Saint-Ouen|Red Star Olympique]] brought him to their squad in 1925. He won the ''[[Coupe de France]]'' in 1928 while at Red Star, and stayed at that club until 1929;&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://www.allezredstar.com/fr_a2z.php&lt;/ref&gt; he then joined [[CASG Paris]], and then had a period at [[Amiens SC]] (1933 to 1934),&lt;ref&gt;Source:http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/historique.php?cherche_joueur=Chantrel&lt;/ref&gt; followed by his return to Red Star, where he would stay until the end of his professional career in 1939. For his last season, Chantrel became a player–coach, helping former World Cup rival from [[Argentina]] [[Guillermo Stábile]] to manage Red Star,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.allezredstar.com/archives/fr_book9.htm and http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-fran-clubs.html&lt;/ref&gt; and helping the club win the [[Ligue 2|Division 2]] championship. Chantrel was [[cap (sport)|capped]] 15 times for the French national team, from 1928 to 1933.

His international debut took place while he was playing for Red Star, on March 11, 1928, against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. In 1930, he was selected to the squad that travelled across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] on board the ''[[SS Conte Verde|Conte Verde]]'' to play in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|first ever World Cup tournament]] in [[Montevideo]]. Chantrel appeared in all three of France's matches. During the first half of the first match against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], with the score 1–0 in favour of France, [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]] [[Alex Thépot]] suffered an injury after a collision with a Mexican player, and was unable to continue playing. Substitutions were not allowed at the time, and Chantrel, a halfback, replaced Thépot in goal from the 24th minute until the end of the match,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30full.html#gra | author=Naskrent, Gwidon S. | publisher=[[RSSSF]]| title=World Cup 1930 details | accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which France won.

Chantrel is the only player in World Cup history to see action as a field player and as a goalkeeper. He is also the only field player ever to replace a goalkeeper after having started the match at a different position. Chantrel's last international match was against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] on March 19, 1933.{{CN|date=February 2015}}

==1928 Amsterdam Summer Games==
He played on the team sent to the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics – Men's team squads#France|1928 Olympic tournament]] in [[Amsterdam]], playing in France's only match, a 4-3 loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jimmy Douglas''' (January 12, 1898 in [[East Newark, New Jersey]] – March 5, 1972 in [[Point Pleasant, New Jersey]]) was a U.S. [[soccer]] [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]] who spent his career in the first [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] (ASL).  He earned nine [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]], making his first appearance for the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]].  Notably, he finished his international career at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], where he posted the first &quot;[[clean sheet]]&quot; in World Cup history.  Douglas was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1953.

==Playing career==
Douglas began his organized playing career with the youth club, Central Juniors of [[Newark, New Jersey]] in 1907 when he was nine years old.  Over the next fourteen years he played for a variety of amateur teams including Ryerson, Antlers, Erie and Swansons.  In 1922, he signed with [[Harrison F.C.]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] (ASL).  However, he remained an amateur, refusing to accept any payment.&lt;sup&gt;{{Wayback |date=20091028130549 |url=http://geocities.com/bethlehem_soccer/gl020424.html }}&lt;/sup&gt;  In the 1922-1923 ASL season, Douglas played twenty-three games, winning fourteen and gaining a 2.44 [[goals against average]] (GAA).  In 1923, he moved to the [[Newark Skeeters]] (at times called Newark F.C.).  Douglas spent two seasons with Newark, still maintaining his amateur status.  In the fall of 1925, Douglas began playing for the [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]].  However, the Newark Skeeters still listed Douglas on their rosters and the Giants were forced to forfeit several games after teams complained to the league.&lt;sup&gt;{{Wayback |date=20091028130206 |url=http://geocities.com/bethlehem_soccer/gl092525.html }}&lt;/sup&gt;  After the Giants got that problem straightened out, Douglas continued to play for them until October 1927 when he moved to the [[Fall River Marksmen]].&lt;sup&gt;{{Wayback |date=20091028125823 |url=http://geocities.com/bethlehem_soccer/gl101027.html }}&lt;/sup&gt;  After one season in Fall River, Douglas then played twelve games of the 1928-1929 season with [[Philadelphia Field Club]] before moving to the [[Brooklyn Wanderers]] for three games.  He then finished the season back with the Fall River Marksmen.  In 1929, Douglas joined the [[New York Nationals (ASL)|New York Nationals]].  In 1930, Charles Stoneham, owner of the Nationals, renamed his team the New York Giants when the original Giants changed their name to [[New York Soccer Club]].  Douglas continued with the new Giants through the 1930 spring and fall season before moving to the [[New York Americans (soccer)|New York Americans]] in 1931.  He played only seven games, then retired.

==National team==
Douglas earned nine [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] between 1924 and 1930.  His first game came as a member of the [[United States at the 1924 Summer Olympics|national team]] in the [[1924 Summer Olympics]].  He backstopped the U.S. to a 1-0 victory over [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] on May 25, 1924, Douglas was named the game’s MVP.  Then four days later, the U.S. lost to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] which put the U.S. out of the tournament.  Douglas then played the next two 1924 U.S. games.  In 1925, he was in the nets for a U.S. 1-0 shutout of [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in [[Montreal]].  In 1930, he returned to the national team at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  Douglas shutout [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] before losing to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the semifinals.  About four minutes into that game, Douglas twisted his knee, then two U.S. players were injured.  As the rules did not allow substitutes at the time, Douglas and his teammates were forced to play injured.  Following the World Cup, the U.S. traveled to [[Rio de Janeiro]] where it lost 4-3 to the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].  Douglas finished his U.S. career with four wins and three shutouts.

The [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] inducted Douglas in 1954.  Douglas died on March 5, 1972 in [[Point Pleasant, New Jersey]].

'''Thomas Florie''' (September 6, 1897 – April 26, 1966) was an American [[soccer]] [[Striker (association football)|forward]]. He played in both the first and second [[American Soccer League (1933-1983)|American Soccer Leagues]], winning two [[National Challenge Cup]] titles.  Florie was also a member of the [[United States men's national soccer team]] at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] and [[1934 FIFA World Cup]]. He was inducted into the U.S. [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

==Early career==
Born in New Jersey to Italian immigrant parents, Florie played soccer as a youth, but service in the Navy during [[World War I]] delayed the start of his career.  In 1922, Florie signed with [[Harrison F.C.]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]].  However, he only played three games before leaving Harrison to play for American A.A. in the West Hudson Amateur League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1925.html U.S. soccer history - 1925]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Soccer League==
In 1924, Florie returned to the ASL when he signed with [[Providence Clamdiggers|Providence F.C.]].  He quickly established himself as one of the top wing forwards in the league.  In 1928, he began the season with Providence, now known as the Gold Bugs, before moving to [[New Bedford Whalers#New Bedford Whalers II|New Bedford Whalers II]].  He later joined [[Fall River F.C.]] but, the team only lasted the spring season before merging with the [[New York Yankees (soccer)|New York Yankees]] to become [[New Bedford Whalers#New Bedford Whalers III|New Bedford Whalers III]].  In 1932, the Whalers defeated [[Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C.]], 8-5 on aggregate in the  [[National Challenge Cup]] final.  Florie scored one goal in each of the two games.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSF&quot;&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usacuphist.html U.S. Open Cup at RSSSF]&lt;/ref&gt;    Despite this victory, the Whalers collapsed that fall, followed soon after by the entire league.  Florie then moved to the [[Pawtucket Rangers]] which had jumped to the second [[American Soccer League (1933-1983)|American Soccer League]].  In 1934, Florie was on the losing side in the National Challenge Cup when the Rangers fell to Stix, Baer and Fuller in three games.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSF&quot;/&gt;  By that time, the Rangers had left the ASL.  In 1941, Florie won his second National Cup when Pawtucket F.C. defeated Detroit Chrysler, 8-5 on aggregate, with Florie scoring one goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSF&quot;/&gt;

==National team==
Florie earned eight [[cap (sports)|caps]], scoring two goals, with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] from 1925 to 1934.  His first cap came in a 1-0 loss to [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] on June 27, 1925.  His second came a year later, this time a 6-2 win over Canada in which Florie scored.  Florie was not called into the national team for the 1928 Olympics, but was called up for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  He was named as the team captain as the U.S. went to the semifinals before falling to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].  His last national team game came in the first round loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det69.html RSSSF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Florie was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

'''Adelino William (&quot;Billy&quot;) Gonsalves''' (sometimes spelt in the Portuguese form, ''Gonçalves'') (August 10, 1908 in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]], [[Rhode Island]] – July 17, 1977 in [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[New Jersey]]) was an [[USA|American]] [[soccer]] player, sometimes described as the &quot;[[Babe Ruth]] of American Soccer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/gonsalves.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent over 25 years playing in various American professional leagues and was a member of the U.S. squad at the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1930 and 1934.  He is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]].

==Youth==
Gonsalves was the seventh of nine children born to Augustine and Rose Gonsalves. His parents had immigrated from [[Portugal]] two years before his birth.  Although born in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]], Gonsalves grew up in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]].  An excellent athlete, Gonsalves boxed and played both [[baseball]] and soccer as a boy.  When he was fourteen, Gonsalves began playing for Pioneer, a local amateur team.  He then went on to play for Charlton Mill and Liberal.  Gonsalves grew in prominence in the local leagues.  &lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/gonsalves.html&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1926, he signed with Lusitania Recreation Club of [[East Cambridge, Massachusetts]].   In 1927, Lusitania won both the Boston city and District League titles.

==Professional career==
In 1927, [[Boston Soccer Club]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] (ASL) signed Gonsalves.  Nineteen years old at the time, Gonsalves joined a team which had taken second in the ASL the previous season and was stocked with talented international players.  Finding it difficult to break into the starting lineup, Gonsalves did not play a game with Boston until Christmas Eve.  However, given the chance, he grabbed it and scored a goal two minutes later.  He went on to find the net six times in his next twenty games.  That season the Wonder Workers also took the league title.

Gonsalves spent one more season with the Wonder Workers before moving to the [[Fall River Marksmen]] of his hometown in 1929.  From the time he joined the Marksmen until the team merged with the [[New York Soccer Club]] in the summer of 1930 to form the [[New York Yankees (soccer)|New York Yankees]], Gonsalves played seventy-five games and scored forty-nine goals.  Additionally, he was the team’s assists leader.  

While playing with the Marksmen, Gonsalves formed a lethal striking partnership with another local player, [[Bert Patenaude]]. The two led Fall River to the [[National Challenge Cup]] title in 1930 and 1931. Overall, Gonslaves won the tournament a record eight times.

The onset of the [[Great Depression]] and the ''Soccer Wars'' had taken a toll on the ASL and teams began to merge or fold.   The Marksmen, one of the strongest ASL teams, had merged with the [[New York Soccer Club]] to form the [[New York Yankees (soccer)|New York Yankees]] in 1930.  Then in 1931, the Yankees moved to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] where the team took up the name of the defunct [[New Bedford Whalers]].  In 1932, the team moved, this time back to Fall River where it was known as [[Fall River F.C.]].

By this time the American Soccer League was collapsing and Gonsalves began looking for other playing opportunities.  In 1933 [[Alex McNab]], a former team-mate who was coaching [[Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C.]] of the [[St. Louis Soccer League]] contacted Gonsalves and offered him a contract.  Gonsalves took the opportunity and moved west.  That year, Gonsalves added another National Cup title to his resume, this time with his new team. Gonsalves spent the 1933-1934 season with Stix, Baer and Fuller, winning the league title.  At the end of the season, he joined the U.S. national team for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Italy]].

On his return to St. Louis, Gonsalves found that McNab had moved to a new team, [[St. Louis Central Breweries F.C.]].  Gonsalves made the move as well and spent the 1934-1935 season with Central Breweries, winning the league title and the 1935 National Cup.  In 1935, Gonsalves moved, this time to the [[St. Louis Shamrocks (1935-1938)|St. Louis Shamrocks]].  The Shamrocks went to both the 1936 and 1937 National Cup championships, but lost both times.  In October 1937, Gonsalves quit the Shamrocks and signed with St. Patrick's.  However, Shamrocks sued St. Patrick's and St. Patrick's settled out of court by agreeing to a player trade.  Despite the agreement, Gonsalves decided not to play for either team and instead signed with Beltmars in the semi-professional second division St. Louis Municipal League.  In February 1938, Gonsalves was back in the SLSL with [[South Side Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/family/corbett/soccer-3.html Bob Corbett's soccer career]&lt;/ref&gt;  He finished the season with the South Siders before moving to [[Chicago Manhattan Beer]].  Then in 1940, he moved back east, joining [[Healy F.C.]] of the [[National Soccer League of New York]], winning the 1941 league title.  In 1941, he moved, this time to the [[Kearny Scots]] of the second [[American Soccer League (1933-1983)|American Soccer League]] (ASL) which was created in 1933 following the collapse of the first ASL.  Gonsalves spent only one season with the Scots before moving to [[Brooklyn Hispano]].  Uncharacteristically for him, Gonsalves spent the next five seasons with Brooklyn.  In his first season with Brooklyn, he scored eight goals in sixteen games.  Brooklyn also won the National Challenge Cup in 1943 and 1944.

In 1947, Gonsalves left Hispano to play for the [[Newark Germans]] of the lower division [[German American Soccer League]].  In 1948, the team became known simply as Newark F.C.  Gonsalves remained with the team until his retirement from playing professionally in 1952.

According to Steve Holroyd, in a professional career spanning twenty-five years, “Gonsalves was also the consummate gentleman on the pitch: legend has it he was never cautioned or ejected from any match for rough play or ungentlemanly conduct.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/gonsalves.html Gonsalves]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National team==
Gonsalves played six times for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], including the first two [[FIFA World Cup]]s in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] and [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. He scored one goal for the US.

Gonsalves was part of the inaugural induction class into the United States [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1950.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2408">'''Aurelio González Benítez''' (25 September 1905 in [[Luque]], [[Paraguay]] – 9 July 1997) was a Paraguayan [[football (soccer)|football]] player.

In the early 1930s he rejected an offer worth millions from [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] of [[Argentina]] in order to fight for his country, [[Paraguay]], in the [[Chaco War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olimpia.com.py/idolos/aurelio_gonzalez.asp Olimpia Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.com.py/mundial2002/croparaguaya1.html Cronologia de la actuacion paraguaya]&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a vital player of the [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguayan national team]] scoring several goals in the 1920s and 1930s, and participated at the [[1930 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=50080/index.html FIFA Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucien Laurent''' (10 December 1907 – 11 April 2005) was a [[France|French]] [[association football]] player. He is famous for having scored the first ever [[FIFA World Cup]] goal.

==Career==
Laurent was born in [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], [[Val-de-Marne]], near [[Paris]].

Between 1921 and 1930, he played for the semi-professional team [[Cercle Athlétique de Paris]], before being taken on by [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]], then a works team for the car manufacturer [[Peugeot]], where he worked. As an [[amateur]] player, he only received basic expenses from the [[French Football Federation]] while at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|tournament in Uruguay]].

It was in [[Uruguay]] that Laurent made history by scoring the first ever World Cup goal: a volley in the 19th minute of a game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] on 13 July 1930. [[France national football team|France]] won the game 4–1, but lost their remaining group matches to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Chile national football team|Chile]], and were thus eliminated. Laurent was ruled out of the third game due to injury.

Injury then also denied Laurent a place in the squad for the [[1934 World Cup]] and he moved to [[Stade Rennais FC|Rennes]], playing for them until 1937, then for [[RC Strasbourg]] until 1939. In all, Laurent played 10 times for France, but scored only one other goal.

When [[World War II]] came, Laurent was called up to join the armed forces and was taken prisoner by the [[Germany|Germans]]. He spent three years as a [[Prisoner of war|POW]], was released in 1943 and played the remaining two years of wartime football for [[Besançon RC|Besançon]]. In 1946, Laurent retired from playing and went on to become a trainer and youth coach. He was the only surviving member of the 1930 French team to see France lift the [[1998 World Cup]] on home soil, and died seven years later at the age of 97 in [[Besançon]].

'''Ernesto Mascheroni''' (21 November 1907  –  3 July 1984) was a [[football (soccer)|footballer]] from [[Uruguay]]. Born in Montevideo, Ernesto was a [[defender (football)|defender]]. He played as a [[left-back]].

He played 12 times for the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] between 1930 and 1939, including in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] where Uruguay won the first ever World Cup tournament. In 1934, he moved to [[Italy]] to play for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Ambrosiana]] (now Inter Milan) until 1936. During this period, he represented the [[Italy national football team]] twice, when the nationality rules were less strict than they now are. He later returned to Uruguay to play for [[C.A. Peñarol]] from 1936 to 1940.

By the time of his death in July 1984, at the age of 76, he was the last surviving member of Uruguay's 1930 World Cup winning team; though it would be another 26 years before the death of the [[Francisco Varallo|last surviving participant of that World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11134965 Last surviving player from first World Cup final dies].&quot; BBC News, 31 Aug. 2010. 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luis Felipe Monti''' (May 15, 1901 – September 9, 1983) was an [[Italian Argentine]] [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Midfielder (association football)|midfielder]] and an Olympian. Monti has the distinction of having played in two [[FIFA World Cup]] final matches with two different national teams. He played the first of these finals with his native [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], which was lost to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]; and the second with [[Italy national football team|Italy]] as one of their ''[[Oriundi]]'' in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]], thanks to his [[Romagna|Romagnol]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gqitalia.it/sport/calcio/mondiali-calcio/2014/06/09/azzurro-oriundo-mumo-orsi-paletta-i-mondiali-dei-naturalizzati/ |title=Azzurro oriundo, ma serve in un Mondiale? |date=9 June 2014 |website=gqitalia.it |publisher=[[GQ]] Italia |access-date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second time Monti was on the winning side in a 2–1 victory over [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]].

Monti was a rugged and ruthless player, but had the technical skills to go with his strong tackling. He played as an attacking [[centre half]] in the old-fashioned ''[[Metodo]]'' system: a position roughly equivalent to the [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive central midfield]] position of today. As such he would mark the opposing [[centre forward]] when his team were defending, but would be the main midfield [[playmaker]] when his team were on the attack, due to his passing and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2015/apr/24/age-position-football-michael-carrick-andrea-pirlo-xabi-alonso|title=The relationship between a player's age and their position on a football pitch|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Blair Newman|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nicknamed ''doble ancho'' (double wide) due to his coverage of the pitch.

==Career==

===Argentina===
[[File:Luismonti 1925casla.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Monti in 1925 while playing at [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]].]]
Monti started his career in 1921 with [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]], where he won the first of his many championships. The following year he signed with [[Boca Juniors]] but left without playing a game. He joined [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] where he won a further three Argentine championships. All of Monti's honours in Argentina were recorded during the [[Amateur Era in Argentine football|Amateur Era]].

Monti was first called up to represent the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]] in 1924. He won the [[1927 South American Championship]] and the Silver Medal at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics – Men's team squads#Mexico|1928 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/&lt;/ref&gt; With Monti as a key player, Argentina cruised to the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], defeating [[France national football team|France]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. Monti scored two goals along the way, and injured  opponents with his tackling. Some sources speculate that Monti was carrying an injury, but whatever the truth, and despite a death threat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-cup-bets.com/world-cup-controversies.php Death threat], 1930 World Cup Final: ''World-Cup-Bets.com'' website. Retrieved on March 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; he had a quiet game as [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] triumphed 4–2.

===Italy===
In 1931 Monti was signed by the Italian club [[Juventus]], as he had Italian citizenship. As he was overweight and out of condition, he had a month's solitary training. Monti was back to top form helping Juventus to four consecutive [[Serie A]] titles (1932 to 1935). Monti went on to play 225 matches and score 19 goals in Italy.

He was also called up, within a year, to play for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] as an ''[[oriundo]]''. Hosts Italy won their way to the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]] final and defeated [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 2–1.

===The Battle of Highbury===
The [[Battle of Highbury]] is a match that took place between Italy and [[England national football team|England]] on November 14, 1934 at [[Highbury]], the home ground of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Monti was playing centre half for Italy, but as early as the second minute he broke a bone in his foot after a clash with England centre forward [[Ted Drake]]. Down to 10 men, in the days before [[Substitute (soccer)|substitutes]], Italy succumbed 2–3. Monti was only to play twice more for Italy.

In total Monti won 16 caps (5 goals) for Argentina between 1924 and 1931, and 18 caps (1 goal) for Italy between 1932 and 1936.

==After football==
Monti became [[Manager (association football)|manager]] after retiring. He died in 1983 aged 82.

'''George Moorhouse''' (May 4, 1901 in [[Liverpool]], [[England]]&amp;nbsp;– July 13, 1982 in [[Long Beach, New York]]) is, reputedly, the first Englishman to appear in a [[FIFA World Cup]].  He spent most of his playing career in the United States and earned seven [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]].  He was a member of the U.S. teams at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] and [[1934 FIFA World Cup]].  Moorhouse was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

==Club career==
A native of [[England]], Moorhouse served in the British [[Merchant Marine]] during the [[First World War]].  After the war, he decided to try his luck in football.  Predominantly left sided, Moorhouse had an unsuccessful trial with [[Leeds United]].  However, he did play two first team matches (December 26, 1921 versus [[Ashington]] and January 28, 1922 versus [[Accrington Stanley]]) whilst with [[Tranmere Rovers]] in the old [[Third Division North]] during the 1921-22 season.  He then played with the Rovers' reserve team in the Cheshire League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/usadave/usawc30.html The myth of British pros on the 1930 U.S. team&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 he emigrated to [[Canada]], eventually gaining a position with the [[Montreal Canadian Pacific Railway]] team.  He spent only a few months with Montreal before transferring to the [[Brooklyn Wanderers]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] (ASL).  He played in only three games before moving to [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]] where he remained for the next seven seasons, scoring 45 goals in over 250 games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/asl.html All time leading scorers of the ASL]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, the Giants were expelled from the ASL during the &quot;Soccer War&quot; and Moorhouse remained with them during their season and a half in the [[Eastern Professional Soccer League]].  In 1929, Moorhouse and the Giants returned to the ASL.  In the summer of 1930, the Giants were sold to new ownership which renamed the team the [[New York Soccer Club]].  Then in 1931, the team merged with the [[Fall River Marksmen]] to become the [[New York Yankees (soccer)|New York Yankees]] for the 1931 spring season.  In the fall of 1931, Moorhouse moved to the [[New York Americans (soccer)|New York Americans]]. In 1933, the first ASL collapsed, to be replaced by a new league, also known as the American Soccer League.  The Americans joined the new league and Moorehouse played with them until 1937 leading that side to two [[National Challenge Cup]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/alltime.html Dave L's All-time American Soccer Team - list and bios&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National team==
Moorhouse earned his first cap in a 6-1 victory over [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] on November 6, 1926.  While he was not called into the team for either of the U.S. games in 1928, he was selected for the U.S. squad at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  The Americans accepted the offer from [[FIFA]] to participate in the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and Moorhouse would play in all three matches in [[Uruguay]] as a defender.  The first U.S. game, a 3-0 victory over [[Belgium]] on July 13, 1930 at [[Estadio Gran Parque Central|Parque Central]] in [[Montevideo]], made Moorhouse the first native-born Englishman to play in the World Cup.  Moorhouse then played the next two matches as the U.S. went to the semifinals only to fall to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a particularly physical game.  Several U.S. players were injured and the team finished with only eight fit field players and a lame goalkeeper as substitutes were not allowed.

The U.S. did not have any international matches until the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Italy]].  Moorhouse was selected as team captain for the cup.  Because the U.S. had applied late for entry into the Cup, the team had to play a qualification match against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in Italy.  The U.S. won, 4-2, but was eliminated in the first round by [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

He was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

==Date of death==
While the National Soccer Hall of Fame lists Moorhouse's date of death as July 13, 1982, several other sources have conflicting information.  Colin Jose, who has served as a historian with the Hall of Fame, lists the date as October 12, 1943 in his history of the American Soccer League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Jose | first = Colin | title = American Soccer League, 1921-1931 | type = Hardback | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1998 | id = (ISBN 0-8108-3429-4) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Dave Litterer, who writes extensively on U.S. soccer, noted that in 1943, &quot;ASL veterans mourned the passing of George Moorhouse, one of its premier players during the 1930s and a frequent participant with the National team, having earned a cap in every one of its games between 1930 and 1938.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1944.html Litterer, Dave ''U.S. Soccer History - 1944'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Nasazzi Yarza''' (24 May 1901 – 17 June 1968) was the [[Uruguay]]an footballer who captained his country when they won the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]].

==Biography==
[[File:Uruguay1926.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Nasazzi (first from left, at bottom) with the Uruguay team in 1928.]]
He was born in Bella Vista, Montevideo to Giuseppe, an Italian immigrant from [[Esino Lario]] (near [[Milan]]), and María Jacinta Yarza from the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] of [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nacional&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacionaldigital.com/biblioteca/Nasazzicue.htm|title=Ha muerto José Nasazzi, &quot;el más grande capitán de la historia&quot;|publisher=Club Nacional de Football|language=Spanish|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/coppa_america/2011/07/01-181416/Cavani,+che+cuore!+L%E2%80%99Uruguay+applaude|title=Cavani, che cuore! L’Uruguay applaude|publisher=Corriere dello Sport|language=it|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasazzi is regarded by many as [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay's]] greatest ever football player. He was known as &quot;''El Gran Mariscal''&quot; (The Great [[Marshal]]) and had already won the gold medal at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]], as well as the [[Copa América|South American Championship]] in [[South American Championship 1923|1923]], [[South American Championship 1924|1924]] and [[South American Championship 1926|1926]], by the time of the first [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. On individual level, he was selected as best player at FIFA World Cup 1930 and twice (1923 &amp; 1935) at South American Championship (the predecessor of Copa America).

During the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] tournament, Uruguay's only serious rivals were their neighbors [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. After defeating [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the first round, Uruguay defeated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] 6–1 in the semi-finals to set up a final against Argentina. Although his team were 2–1 behind at half-time, Nasazzi rallied his teammates in the second half, leading them to a 4–2 victory and making himself the first captain to lift the [[Jules Rimet Trophy]].

Although Uruguay refused to defend their title in 1934, Nasazzi won the South American Championship again (in [[South American Championship 1935|1935]]), before retiring in 1937 with 41 international appearances.

==Nasazzi's Baton==
''Nasazzi's Baton'' is an unofficial title named after José similar to the [[Unofficial Football World Championship]]. It is said to have been held by Uruguay after the first World Cup, and subsequently to have been taken over by any team to beat the holders over 90 minutes in a full international match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasazzi.com/ |title=Le Baton de Nasazzi| accessdate=29 July 2015 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arnold “Lucky Arnie” Oliver''' (May 22, 1907 in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] – October 16, 1993 in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]) was a U.S. [[soccer]] [[Striker (association football)|inside forward]].  He spent at least six seasons in the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]].  He was a member of the U.S. team at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] and is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]].

==Club career==
Oliver, the son of British immigrants, began his career with the New Bedford Quisset Mill, a cotton mill, club when he was fourteen.  He then played with the [[Shawsheen Indians]], a local amateur club which joined the professional [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] in 1925.  However, Oliver remained an amateur and when the Indians folded during the season, he moved to the Defenders Club, winning the 1926 [[National Amateur Cup]] title with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/natamateur.html U.S. Amateur Cup champions]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the Amateur Cup final, Oliver turned professional when he signed with the [[New Bedford Whalers]].  He played only one game with the Whalers and in 1927, he moved to the [[Hartford Americans]].  However, they were kicked out of the league after only ten games and Oliver moved to [[J&amp;P Coats]] for the remainder of the season.  He spent most of the 1928-1929 season with J&amp;P Coats, but finished the season with the [[New Bedford Whalers]].  Oliver then moved to the [[Pawtucket Rangers]] for the fall 1929 season.  In the fall of 1930, he began the season with the Marksmen before transferring to the [[Providence Gold Bugs]].  In the spring of 1931, he played with [[Fall River F.C.]] then with the [[Pawtucket Rangers]] in the fall of 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Jose | first = Colin | title = American Soccer League, 1921-1931 | type = Hardback | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1998 | id = (ISBN 0-8108-3429-4) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state Oliver ended his career in the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] in 1931, others say 1935.  However, all agree that he finished his career with the amateur Santo Christos in 1938.

==National team==
In 1930, Oliver was called into the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  He did not enter any of the U.S. games at the tournament but played several exhibition games during the U.S. team's South American tour following the cup.  However, none of those games are considered full internationals.

==Coaching==
Following his retirement from playing, Oliver coached extensively.  In 1966, he became the first head coach of the [[UMass Dartmouth]] men’s soccer team.  From the team’s founding in 1966 through the 1969 season, Oliver took the team to a 40-11-2 record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umassd.edu/sports/menssoccer/archive.cfm UMass soccer coaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1968, the New England Soccer Hall of Fame in 1981&lt;ref&gt;[http://neshof.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/inductees.htm 2006 New England Soccer Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UMass Dartmouth]] Hall of Fame in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umassd.edu/sports/halloffame/fulllist.cfm UMass Sports Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertrand &quot;Bert&quot; Arthur Patenaude''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|t|n|oʊ|d}}; November 4, 1909{{spaced ndash}}November 4, 1974) was an American [[Association football|soccer]] player. Although earlier disputed, he is now officially credited by [[FIFA]] as the scorer of the first [[hat-trick]] in [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/18/bert-patenaude-usa-world-cup-hat-trick|title=Bert Patenaude, the forgotten hero who scored the first ever World Cup hat-trick|accessdate=21 July 2015|date = 19 July 2015|first = Jack|last = Williams|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame|United States Soccer Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qVYAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA489&amp;lpg=PA489&amp;dq=Bert+Patenaude&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DRsjyBMD3U&amp;sig=vkHEePApznwm5KpRNgxLFvWkVy4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgoahUKEwj2y4Wtye7GAhUJVxQKHdYHAPo#v=onepage&amp;q=Bert%20Patenaude&amp;f=false |title=The American Soccer League: The Golden Years of American Soccer 1921-1931 - Colin Jose |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=1998-06-25 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
In 1928, Patenaude began his professional career with [[Philadelphia Field Club]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]]. In his eight games with Philadelphia, he scored six goals. Despite this productivity, he moved to [[J&amp;P Coats]] for one league game, then moved again to his hometown [[Fall River Marksmen]]. He remained in Fall River until the summer of 1930, winning the 1930 [[National Challenge Cup]] before moving to the [[Newark Americans]].&lt;ref name=open&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usacuphist.html|title=U.S. Open Cup at RSSSF|accessdate=21 July 2015|date = 16 July 2015|first1=Dave|last1=Litterer|first2=Jim|last2=Goloboy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored seven goals in five games at the start of the 1930-1931 season, but found himself back with the Marksmen for the end of the season. In 1931, Fall River merged with the [[New York Soccer Club]] to form the [[New York Yankees (soccer)|New York Yankees]]. However, Fall River had already begun playing National Cup games. Therefore, while the Yankees won the National Cup, the records show the winner as Fall River. In the cup championship, Patenaude scored five goals in the Yankees' 6-2 first game victory over Chicago's [[Bricklayers and Masons F.C.]]&lt;ref name=open/&gt; Patenaude remained with the Yankees through the spring of 1931. In the fall of 1931, he played with the [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]].

The ASL was collapsing by the fall of 1931 and records are incomplete, but it appears that in 1933, Patenaude signed with the [[Philadelphia German-Americans]] of the second American Soccer League. In 1934, Patenaude moved west to sign with [[St. Louis Central Breweries F.C.|St. Louis Central Breweries]] of the [[St. Louis Soccer League]], at that point the only professional league in the country. Central Breweries, stocked with future Hall of Famers, won the league and 1935 [[National Challenge Cup]] titles.&lt;ref name=open/&gt; In 1935, Central Breweries left the league, became an independent team and lost the sponsorship of the brewery. Patenaude remained with the team, now called [[St. Louis Shamrocks (1935-1938)|St. Louis Shamrocks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websteruniv.edu/~corbetre/family/corbett/soccer-2.html] {{wayback|url=http://www.websteruniv.edu/~corbetre/family/corbett/soccer-2.html |date=20071028203607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the Shamrocks went to the National Cup final before falling to the Philadelphia German-Americans.&lt;ref name=open/&gt; In 1936, Patenaude returned east where he played with [[Philadelphia Nationals|Philadelphia Passon]] of the ASL.

==National team==
In 1930, Patenaude was called into the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. In that cup, he scored a goal in the U.S. opener against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], then a hat trick in the 3-0 victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. Following the U.S. elimination by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the semifinals, the U.S. went on an exhibition tour of South America, ending with a 4-3 loss to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in which Patenaude scored his sixth and final U.S. goal and never again appeared with the national setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/columns/story?id=5370416 |title=Fall River's Bert Patenaude had World Cup's first hat trick |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patenaude's record of four goals in one World Cup remains the standard for an American player. Additionally, his total stood as the all-time career mark for an American player for eighty years, until it was broken by [[Landon Donovan]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

===World Cup hat trick===
Patenaude's historic day came on July 17, 1930, as the United States played [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural World Cup]]. Patenaude scored the opening goal in the tenth minute. A second goal in the fifteenth minute had been credited several different ways: as an own goal by [[Aurelio González (footballer)|Aurelio González]] (according to the RSSSF), a regular goal by the U.S.'s [[Tom Florie]] (according to the official FIFA match record), or as Patenaude's second goal (according to the [[United States Soccer Federation]]). A fiftieth-minute goal by Patenaude gave the U.S. a 3-0 win over the South Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.si.com/longform/soccer-goals/goal10.html |title=The 10 Most Significant Goals In U.S. Soccer History: Bert Patenaude &amp;#124; Longform |publisher=SI.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helms |first=Andrew |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118499/usa-belgium-reliving-usmnts-wild-run-1930-world-cup |title=USA-Belgium: Reliving the USMNT's Wild Run in the 1930 World Cup |publisher=The New Republic |date=2014-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute and discrepancies over the second goal had led to confusion over the first-ever World Cup hat-trick, as Argentina's [[Guillermo Stábile]] scored one against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] just two days after the USA-Paraguay game. However, FIFA announced on November 10, 2006, that Patenaude was indeed the first person to score a hat-trick in World Cup play, confirming that he scored all three goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/107/499/ |title=American Bert Patenaude credited with first hat trick in FIFA World Cup™ history |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2015-07-15 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patenaude was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame|U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1971. He died in Fall River on his sixty-fifth birthday.

'''Pedro Petrone Schiavone''' (May 11, 1905 – December 13, 1964) was a [[Uruguay]]an [[football (soccer)|footballer]] in the striker role. His nickname '''''Artillero''''', meaning artilleryman or gunner in reference to his amazing goalscoring prowess.

In his career he played for [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], where he won two National Tournaments (1924, 1934) and in [[Italy]] with [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], where he played 44 games and scored 37 goals (Top goalscorer in Serie A 1931-32). Whilst in Italy, Petrone was timed in the hundred metres at 11 seconds and was said to be the fastest player in the League.

Two times golden medalist in the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, Petrone also won the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He was 19 years and 1 month old when he received the 1924 gold medal and the tournament top-goalscorer award, still remaining to this day the youngest ever football golden medalist in the history of the Olympic Games.

Petrone won 29 official caps for Uruguay, scoring 24 goals, but early non-FIFA officiated matches would bring his record to 80 caps and 36 goals. He is currently seventh (7th) in the Uruguay top-goalscorers list.

He died in [[Montevideo]] at the age of 59 years.

'''Carlos Desiderio Peucelle''' (September 13, 1908 – April 1, 1990) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Association football|football]] player who played inside right/wing and is considered one of Argentina's finest wingers in their history. He is also known for being the catalyst for starting &quot;La Maquina&quot; with River Plate who went on to dominate football in South America in the 1940s.

==Playing career==
Peucelle played first team football for [[Club Atlético San Telmo|San Telmo]] and [[Club Sportivo Buenos Aires|Sportivo Buenos Aires]] before joining Argentine giants [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] for a fee of 10,000 pesos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20071020025242 |url=futbolfactory.futbolweb.net/index.php?ff=historicos&amp;f2=00001&amp;idjugador=326 |title=Futbol Factory article }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peucelle was part of two [[Copa América]] winning squads, in [[South American Championship 1929|1929]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/29safull.html RSSSF South American Championship 1929]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South American Championship 1937|1937]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/37safull.html RSSSF South American Championship 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel Rosas Sánchez''' (April 17, 1912 in [[Mexico City]]- February 20, 1989), nicknamed ''Chaquetas'', was a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who participated in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. He was the first player in the history of [[FIFA World Cup]] who scored a goal from the [[penalty kick]] spot (against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/results/matches/match=1086/report.html&lt;/ref&gt; With the first goal he scored during the World Cup, he became at the time the youngest player to have scored in the FIFA World Cup, a record later broken by [[Pelé]], although Rosas remains second youngest. He was also the first Mexican player to score multiple goals in world cup play (the first to score more than two goals was Luis Hernandez, 68 years later) and the first player to score a [[own goal]] in the history of [[FIFA World Cup]](against [[Chile national football team|Chile]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/results/matches/match=1095/report.html&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother, [[Felipe Rosas]], also played in the 1930 World Cup. Both were players of [[Atlante F.C.]] during the tournament.

'''Héctor Pedro Scarone Beretta''' (26 November 1898 – 4 April 1967) was a [[Uruguay]]an [[association football|football]] striker. He was from 1930 to 2011 the all-time leading scorer with 31 goals in 52 games between 1917 and 1930 for the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguayan national team]].

==Club career==
At club level, Scarone spent most of his career with [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], with whom he won the Uruguayan championship eight times. He scored a total of 301 goals for the club in 369 appearances.

He also played for Spanish side [[FC Barcelona]], and [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Inter Milan]] and [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]] in Italy.

==National team==
He won the [[Copa América|South American Championship]] four times: in [[South American Championship 1917|1917]], [[South American Championship 1923|1923]], [[South American Championship 1924|1924]], and [[South American Championship 1926|1926]], and the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic gold medal twice]]: in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]].

At the age of 19, he scored the goal that gave Uruguay the title at the [[1917 South American Championship]], in the final against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], his fourth international match.

Scarone finished his international career by leading Uruguay to the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], and although his international career ended that same year, the 31 goals in 52 matches (actually 52, but 21 goals were in unofficial matches) he scored for his country stood until {{As of |2011|lc=on}} as the national record.

'''Philip &quot;Phil&quot; Slone''' (January 20, 1907 in [[New York, New York]] – November 4, 2003 in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]) was a U.S. [[soccer]] [[midfielder|wing half]].  He spent a single season each in the short lived Eastern Soccer League and Atlantic Coast Conference, then ten years in the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]].  He was a member of the U.S team at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] and is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]].

==Youth==
Slone grew up in [[New York City]] and attended Manhattan’s High School of Commerce.  He was a multi-sport athlete, earning varsity letters in [[baseball]], [[basketball]] and [[soccer]].  After high school, he attended [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John’s University]].  He graduated in 1929 with a degree in law.

==Club career==
While in high school, [[SC Hakoah Wien]] a powerhouse [[Austria]]n team toured the U.S.  During that tour, members of the team saw Slone playing and when they moved to the U.S. in 1928 to form a team in the [[Eastern Soccer League]] (ESL), they invited Slone, then in college to play with them.  Slone signed with [[New York Hakoah]] of the ESL in 1928, beginning his twelve-year professional career.  That first season was difficult.  As he remembers it, &quot;Life was hectic then.  I played professional soccer on the weekends, worked during the week and went to evening classes at St. John's University Law School.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/medical/news/newsid=71875.html Philip Slone - The Lone Survivor]&lt;/ref&gt;

A little background is required to understand the next two years of Slone’s career.  The ESL was created during the “Soccer War” which pitted the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] and the [[United States Football Association|USFA]].  After three ASL teams were expelled from the league, they joined several other teams to form the ESL.  This league lasted a season and a half before merging with the ASL at the end of the “Soccer War”.  New York Hakoah was owned by Maurice Vandeweghe, who also owned the [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]] of the ASL.  The merger of the ESL and ASL meant that Vandeweghe now owned to teams in the same league.  League rules forbid that, so Vandeweghe sold Hakoah.  When he did, Slone jumped to Vandeweghe's other team, the Giants.

In June 1930, Slone left the U.S. to play in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  He and his team mates returned to discover the ASL had experienced a reshuffling of teams in their absence.  As a result, Slone left the Giants, now named the Nationals, to sign with the [[Hakoah All-Stars]] which had been formed by the merger of his old team, New York Hakoah of the ESL and Brooklyn Hakoah of the ASL.  The All Stars played until 1932 when they folded at the end of the season.  Slone then moved to [[New York Brookhattan]].  The ASL folded in 1933, but was immediately replaced by a second [[American Soccer League (1933-1983)|American Soccer League]].  Slone continued to play with Brookhattan in the second ASL until his retirement in 1940.

==National team==
Slone earned one [[cap (sports)|cap]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] in 1930 when he traveled to [[Uruguay]] for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  However, his cap did not come during the finals, but in an August 17, 1930 loss to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] following the cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det69.html USA - Details of International Matches 1885-1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slone was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.  He died in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] in 2003.

'''Guillermo Stábile''' (17 January 1905 – 26 December 1966) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Association football|footballer]] and manager. At club level, Stábile won two national championships with [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]] and played in Italy and France. He was the top-scorer of the first [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]]. As manager, he led Argentina to victory at six [[Copa América|South American Championship]]s and the suburban Buenos Aires side [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] to three league titles.

==Early career==
Stábile was born in [[Parque Patricios]], [[Buenos Aires]]. He began his career with local club Sportivo Metán and from 1920, with [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]]. In 1924, he progressed to the first team which played in Argentina's top league, which then still had amateur status. He started out on the right wing but soon evolved into a [[centre forward]]. Stábile won many competitions with Huracán, most notably the championships of 1925 and 1928 and the regional trophy ''Copa Dr. Carlos Ibarguren'' in 1925.

===Genoa===
After capturing the world's attention with his impressive feats in the First World Cup, he was signed by [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. He instantly became a fan favourite, scoring a [[hat-trick]] on his debut against rivals [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]]. He stayed with the Genoan club for five years, playing 41 games and scoring 16 goals.

===Napoli===
During the 1935–36 season, he moved to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] with [[Antonio Vojak]] transferring the other way to Genoa. This was during the era where with [[Attila Sallustro]] another South American legend played for Napoli. The club finished 8th in the league with Stábile scoring three goals in twenty games.

===Red Star Paris===
As a last act of his playing career, Stábile moved to [[Red Star Saint-Ouen|Red Star Paris]] in Paris, the club founded by [[Jules Rimet]], who led to the first World Cup in 1930. He stayed with the club until 1939 with the last honour of his playing career being helping the club achieve promotion, from [[Ligue 2|Division 2]] back into [[Ligue 1|Division 1]]. He also served as [[player-manager]] for the club.

==International career==
[[File:Stabile goal v uruguay 1930.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stábile celebrating the Argentina's 2nd. goal v. Uruguay at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] final.]]
Stábile made his debut for the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]] at the age of 25, in his team's second match in the first ever [[1930 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] held in 1930 in [[Uruguay]]. He did not play in Argentina's first match of the competition against [[France national football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/results/matches/match=1085/report.html] FIFA Match Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

His debut came in the following game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] because the first choice striker [[Roberto Cherro]] couldn't play due to an anxiety attack. The game finished 6–3 to Argentina, with Stábile scoring a [[hat-trick]] on his debut. This was long thought to be the first [[FIFA World Cup hat-tricks|World Cup hat-trick]], until 76 years later on 10 November 2006 world football's governing body [[FIFA]] declared that [[Bert Patenaude]] had scored the first hat-trick two days prior to Stábile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71481 MSN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final game of the group stages saw Argentina facing South American rivals [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. They won the game 3–1 with Stábile scoring twice, meaning that Argentina had qualified for the [[semi-finals]], against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. The South Americans breezed through, with a 6–1 victory; Stábile added two more goals to his account and securing Argentina a place in the [[Final (competition)|finals]].

On 30 July 1930, the first ever World Cup final took place, between Argentina and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. At half time Argentina led 2–1, Stábile having scored the second goal. However, they went on to lose 4–2.

Despite losing the final, Stábile made history, becoming the top scorer in the first ever [[1930 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], with his tally of 8 goals in 4 games. It turned out that he would never play for Argentina again, and thus he scored in every game he played for his country, with an average of two goals per match.

==Managerial career==
Stábile had received his first taste of managing, way back in the 1931–32 season at Genoa, long before he retired from playing. Here he spent the aforementioned season as a co-manager, alongside Luigi Burlando.

After a year at Red Star Paris, he became [[player-manager]] for the club; this included the season in which they were promoted from Ligue 2. Stábile left the French club, to coach the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]]. He began his spell in 1939.

Stábile coached Argentina to six [[Copa América|South American Championship]] trophies: in [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]]. After the first round exit at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], where Argentina lost the last of its three matches with 1–6 to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], his time with the national side came to a halt. He was called back to the helm of Argentina in 1960 and he led Argentina in the third and last edition of the [[Panamerican Championship|Panamerican Football Championship]], which took place in Costa Rica.

With the Argentine national side, as a coach (just as he had as a player) Stábile, set records; he coached the national team in 123 official matches gaining 83 victories, making him one of the few coaches with more than 100 international matches in charge.

While managing the national side, he also had spells coaching three other clubs, first the club where he began his career, [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]] and then later [[Ferro Carril Oeste|Ferro]] and [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]]. He led Racing to three consecutive championships between 1949 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/players/arg-coach-champ.html RSSSF:Argentina – Coaches of Championship Teams – First Level]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stábile retired from management in 1960 to take up the role of director of the Argentine national school of football managing, a post he held, until his death in 1966.

'''Raphael “Ralph” Tracey''' ''(sometimes misspelled as Ralf Tracy)'' (February 6, 1904 in [[Gillespie, Illinois]] – March 6, 1975 [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) was a former U.S. [[soccer]] player.  Tracey spent his club career with several teams in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  He also played in all three U.S. games at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  He is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]].

==Club career==
While born in Illinois, Tracey grew up in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  He began his club career as a [[Striker (association football)|forward]] with [[St. Louis Vesper Buick]] of the [[St. Louis Soccer League]] (SLSL) during the 1925 season.  While he was the second leading scorer on the team, he was released during the 1925-1926 season.  He then signed with [[Ben Millers]] and finished the season with them.  He moved to the midfield with the Ben Millers; playing on the team which lost the 1926 [[U.S. Open Cup|National Challenge Cup]] to [[Bethlehem Steel F.C.]].&lt;sup&gt;{{Wayback |date=20091028130204 |url=http://geocities.com/bethlehem_soccer/gl040926c.html }}&lt;/sup&gt;  He scored six goals during the 1931-1932 season, tying for sixth in the league.

==National team==
Tracey earned three [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[USMNT|U.S. national team]] at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].

'''Francisco Antonio &quot;Pancho&quot; Varallo''' ({{IPA-es|fɾanˈsisko anˈtonjo ˈpantʃo βaˈɾaʝo}}; {{Nowrap|5 February 1910}} – {{Nowrap|30 August 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100&quot; /&gt;) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Forward (association football)|football forward]]. He played for the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]] from 1930 to 1937. He was a member of Argentina's squad at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural]] [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1930. During his career, Varallo won three leagues titles with [[Boca Juniors]], and with 181 goals, is the club's second highest all-time leading goalscorer in the professional era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/43703|publisher=''Buenos Aires Herald''|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varallo died in his home-town of [[La Plata]] on {{Nowrap|30 August 2010}}, at the age of 100, as the last surviving player from the [[1930 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/boca-juniors/gol-luto_0_326367514.html |title=El gol está de luto |newspaper=[[Olé (sports newspaper)|Olé]] |language=Spanish |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Varallo was born in [[La Plata]] ([[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Argentina]]), on 5 February 1910. He made his debut at the age of 14, and early in his career gained the nickname ''cañoncito'' (in English: &quot;little cannon&quot;) for his shooting ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100&quot; /&gt;

At the age of 18, Varallo had a trial with [[Estudiantes de La Plata]], scoring eleven goals in three games for the club. However, the board of the club where Varallo was a youth team player were supporters of Estudiantes' town rivals [[Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]], and therefore denied him the opportunity to join Estudiantes. Varallo ultimately joined Gimnasia, making his debut for the club's reserve side, before making his debut for the first team in 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100&quot; /&gt; During his first season with Gimnasia, Varallo won the [[Amateur era in Argentine football|amateur league championship]] with the club, defeating [[Boca Juniors]] in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-Obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Francisco 'Pancho' Varallo obituary|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/aug/31/francisco-pancho-varallo|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2010|date=31 August 2010|author=Brian Glanville|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the forward was loaned for free by Gimnasia to [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] to play for the team during their Pan-American tour.&lt;ref name=velez&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.velezsarsfield.net/club/historia/ |title=Historia del Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield |publisher=VelezSarsfield.net |language=Spanish |accessdate=27 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He totaled 16 goals during the tour.&lt;ref name=velez/&gt;

==Boca Juniors==
Varallo moved to Boca Juniors for the start of the 1931 season (the first professional season in Argentina)&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-Obituary&quot; /&gt; for a fee of approximately $8000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varallo, el goleador del siglo (Spanish)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Varallo, el goleador del siglo (Spanish)|url=http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/Varallo-goleador-siglo_0_163500072.html|publisher=''La Razon''|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to play for the club for the next nine years during which time he won the [[Argentine Primera División]] three times, in 1931, 1934 and 1935, as well as coming runner up in 1933, when he was the [[List of Argentine Primera División topscorers|top goalscorer]] in the league and of South America scoring 34 goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100&quot; /&gt;

In his nine years at Boca Juniors he became the club's top goal-scorer of the professional era, with 180 goals in 210 League games (scoring average 0.85 per game),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lechampions.it/?p=1610 |title=Francisco Varallo (1910–2010) |publisher=LECHAMPIONS.it |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a record that stood until 2008 when it was broken by [[Martín Palermo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-Obituary&quot; /&gt;

During the 1930s Varallo formed strong partnerships with teammates [[Roberto Cherro]] and [[Delfín Benítez Cáceres]], who both also scored over 100 goals for the club. In 1938, he was only able to play one game because of a bad knee injury and, although he played more frequently the next year, was forced to retire in 1940, aged 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-Obituary&quot; /&gt;

==International career==
Varallo was a member of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina's]] squad at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural World Cup]] in 1930, held in [[Uruguay]], where he was the youngest player.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xinhua&quot; /&gt; He played in all three of the team's group games; scoring one goal in the match against Mexico, but missed the semi-final against the United States due to injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francisco Varallo, the last surviving player from the first World Cup final, dies aged 100&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Francisco Varallo, the last surviving player from the first World Cup final, dies aged 100|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1307667/Francisco-Varallo-Last-surviving-player-World-Cup-final-dies-aged-100.html|publisher=''Daily Mail''|accessdate=31 August 2010|location=London|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was fit to play in the World Cup final against Uruguay and started at [[inside right|inside right forward]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-Obituary&quot; /&gt; Argentina were leading 2–1 at half time, but eventually lost to the hosts 4–2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francisco Varallo, the last surviving player from the first World Cup final, dies aged 100&quot;/&gt;

Varallo was also a member of the Argentine team that won the [[Copa América|South American Championship]] in [[1937 South American Championship|1937]]. He scored three goals during the tournament, including a brace in the 2–1 win over [[Chile national football team|Chile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100&quot;/&gt;

==After retirement==
Varallo retired from football in 1940, due to injury problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-Obituary&quot; /&gt;

Varallo's career was recognised in 1994, when he was awarded with the [[FIFA Order of Merit]] for his contributions to football.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-Obituary&quot; /&gt; He has also received honours from the [[Argentine Football Association]] and the [[CONMEBOL|South American Football Confederation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Xinhua&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Last survival of World Cup 1930 dies|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-08/31/c_13470407.htm|publisher=''Xinhua''|accessdate=31 August 2010|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his late 90s Varallo had joked that he would have to come out of retirement should [[Martín Palermo]] overtake his record of 181 professional goals for Boca.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football glory Francisco Varallo dies at age 100&quot; /&gt;

He marked his 100th birthday in February 2010 in his hometown near Buenos Aires by recalling the 1930 clash between his country and neighbouring Uruguay. In an interview he gave to FIFA to mark his birthday, he stated that losing in the final to Uruguay was his 'greatest disappointment'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last surviving player from first World Cup final dies&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Last surviving player from first World Cup final dies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11134965|publisher=''BBC News''|accessdate=31 August 2010|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{wikinews|Last surviving participant of the 1930 FIFA World Cup Francisco Varallo dies aged 100}}
Varallo died on 30 August 2010, in his hometown of La Plata at the age of 100. Leading tributes to the former player, [[FIFA]] president [[Sepp Blatter]] stated that &quot;''The news that Francisco Varallo is no longer with us fills us with great sense of loss, both for his qualities as a person and an ambassador for our beloved sport&amp;nbsp;... In these grief-filled moments I can take immense pride from the fact that a character such as Francisco Varallo, whom we shall never forget, represented the football family with such dignity''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;An idol bids final farewell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=An idol bids final farewell|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1292329.html|publisher=''FIFA''|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the [[CONMEBOL|South American Football Confederation]] [[Nicolás Léoz]] also released a statement expressing sadness at Varallo's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;En memoria de un pionero de nuestra grandeza&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=En memoria de un pionero de nuestra grandeza|url=http://www.conmebol.com/conmebol/mainMedia.html?id=16478&amp;viewpage='full'|publisher=''CONMEBOL''|accessdate=31 August 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his death, both of his former clubs, Gimnasia and Boca announced a day of mourning, while the South American Football Confederation announced that a minute's silence was to be held during all [[Copa Sudamericana]] fixtures the following week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profundo dolor por el fallecimiento de Varallo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Profundo dolor por el fallecimiento de Varallo|url=http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12456:profundo-dolor-por-el-fallecimiento-del-gran-qpanchoq-varallo&amp;catid=180:afa&amp;Itemid=219|publisher=''Argentinian Football Association''|accessdate=31 August 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank J. “Frankie” Vaughn''' ''(also spelled Vaughan)''&lt;ref name=&quot;vaughan&quot;&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1920.html U.S. Soccer History - 1920]&lt;/ref&gt; (February 18, 1902 – July 9, 1959) was a U.S. [[soccer]] [[defender (football)|full back]].  He spent his entire career in St. Louis with the [[Ben Millers]], was on the U.S. roster for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] and is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]].

==Professional career==
Vaughn was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and spent his professional career with [[Ben Millers]] in the [[St. Louis Soccer League]] during the 1920s and 1930s.  However, he is not listed on the team’s roster for either its 1920 [[National Challenge Cup]] championship or when it finished as runner-up in the 1926 National Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usacuphist.html U.S. Open Cup at RSSSF]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, he was part of a St. Louis All Star team which toured Scandinavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaughan&quot;/&gt;

==National team==
In 1920, Vaughn was called into the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].  While he did not play in any of the cup games, he did play in several exhibition matches during the U.S. team’s tour of South America following its elimination.  These games were against club and regional, not national, teams so they do not count as full internationals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det69.html U.S. results at RSSSF]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Vaughn never officially played for the U.S.

Vaughn died in his home city of St. Louis.  He was inducted into the St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame in 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://eteamz.active.com/stlsoccerhalloffame/news/index.cfm?cat=466590 St.Louis Soccer Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

'''Émile Veinante''' (12 June 1907 in [[Metz]] – 18 November 1983 in [[Dury, Somme|Dury]], Somme) was a [[France national football team|French]] footballer and coach. 

Veinante was primarily a forward. He began his club career in 1916 with the youth squad at [[FC Metz]], which was at that time (before the end of the First World War) still in German-controlled [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. He stayed with FC Metz until 1929, when he moved to [[Racing Club de Paris]] in the [[Ligue 1|French first division]] from 1929–1940, with whom he won the French [[Double (association football)|Double]] in 1936, winning the national championship and the cup title. He was named French player of the year in that year. He retired from professional club soccer in 1940.

Between February 1929 and January 1940 Veinante played 24 international matches for the French national team, scoring 14 goals. He appeared in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] World Cups, and as a reserve in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. In 1938, against Belgium, he scored a goal in the first minute of play.

In 1940 Veinante became manager of Racing Paris, until 1943. He also managed [[Racing Club de Strasbourg]] from 1945–1947 and 1948–49, [[OGC Nice]] in 1949–50, [[FC Metz]] in 1950–51, [[FC Nantes]] from 1951–1955, and RC Strasbourg again in 1960–61.

'''Alexandre Villaplane''' (12 September 1905 in [[Algiers]]&lt;ref name=FFFprofile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.fr/equipes-de-france/tous-les-joueurs/fiche-joueur/917-alexandre-villaplane|language=French|publisher=[[French Football Federation]]|title= Accueil &gt; Equipe de France &gt; Tous les joueurs &gt; VILLAPLANE Alexandre|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 26 December 1944 in [[Fort de Montrouge]], [[Arcueil]]) was a French [[Association football|football]] player, who played in the role of midfielder.  Villaplane was also a Nazi collaborator who was arrested and executed for his actions during World War II.

In his career he played for [[FC Sète]] (1921–1924), [[Nimes Olympique]] (1927–1929), [[Racing Club de Paris|Racing Club de France]] (1929–1932), [[FC Antibes]] (1932–1933) and [[OGC Nice]] (1933–1934). He was capped 25 times for the [[France national football team]] and was the captain of the French side which went to the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name=FFFprofile/&gt;

He played for Antibes in the very first French professional championship in 1932–33; Antibes were disqualified that season for corruption. He then joined OGC Nice for the 1933–34 season. Having lost interest in his career and having become a regular horse race-goer, he made one last attempt to resurrect his career with the Bordeaux Second Division club Hispano-Bastidienne, but he ended the season in prison, having been sentenced for his part in a horse race fixing scandal.

At the beginning of World War 2, Villaplane became involved in the Parisian black market and in racketeering the local Jewish population. He was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for [[possession of stolen goods]] in 1940. He then joined a group formed by [[Henri Lafont]] and [[Pierre Bonny]] which would become the French Gestapo. He specialised in racketeering gold merchants.

In 1942, he left Paris for Toulouse to escape the Germans he had been trying to fleece. His former teammate [[Louis Cazal]] obtained new identity papers for him and he returned to Paris. He was arrested by the SS in 1943 for the theft of a quantity of precious stones and imprisoned at the Compiègne camp, although Lafont succeeded in obtaining his release.

Villaplane then became Bonny’s chauffeur and then, in 1944, head of one of the five sections of the North African Brigade, a criminal organisation made up of North African immigrants which collaborated with the Nazis through anti-Resistance activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2009/nov/16/france The forgotten story of ... the France football captain who murdered for Hitler] Paul Doyle,  Monday 16 November 2009 14.11 GMT guardian.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The fierce character of his recruits earned him the unflattering nickname of &quot;SS Mohammed&quot;. He obtained both the rank and uniform of an [[SS-Untersturmführer]]. His section was put in charge of finding Resistance members and their supporters in the region of [[Périgueux]] in the month of March 1944, and then in the region of [[Eymet]] in the following month. It was in Eymet that he negotiated for the lives of hostages for money. On 11 June 1944, the day following the massacre at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], he had 52 people executed in [[Mussidan]].

He was sentenced to death on 1 December 1944 for his direct involvement in at least 10 killings. He was executed by firing squad on 26 December 1944 at the Fort de Montrouge.

'''Rudolf 'Rudy' Wetzer''' (17 March 1901 &amp;ndash; 13 April 1993) was a Romanian football player and manager.  He was the captain and team-coach alongside [[Octav Luchide]], under the management of [[Costel Rădulescu]] of the first [[Romania]]n side to participate in a [[FIFA World Cup]]. He was of [[Jewish]] ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sem40.ru/sport/24860/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In club football Wezter played for [[FC Petrolul Ploiești|Juventus Bucureşti]] (who were Romanian national champions in 1929-1930 season),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romaniansoccer.ro/clubs_2/juventus_bucuresti/juventus_bucuresti.shtml Juventus Bucuresti&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as such he was a colleague of squad members Vogl and [[Ladislau Raffinsky]]. In the 1920s he had played for [[Unirea Timişoara]] (appearing, whilst with them, at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympic Games]]) and [[Chinezul]] before moving on.  His last matches for Romania (played while he was playing for [[Ripensia]] were in 1932; his last match came in a 2-0 defeat to [[Bulgaria]] in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotbal.net/content/view/373/439/ Fotbal Minut Cu Minut - Romanian Soccer | Anul 1932 | Ripensia, Cao, Antrenor, RomÂnia, Bodola&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise he played for [[BSK Beograd|BSK Belgrade]], [[Újpest FC]], [[Hyères FC]], [[ILSA Timişoara]] and [[Craiovan Craiova]]. While playing in Hungary, he used the name Rudolf Veder, in Serbia, Rudolf Večer.

==International career==
During the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] Wetzer became Romania's team captain and team-coach alongside [[Octav Luchide]], under the management of [[Costel Rădulescu]]. This was Rădulescu's decision in the weeks prior to the tournament. In May 1930 the Romanians had lost the [[King Alexander's Cup]] (a two team event) to [[Yugoslavia]] in [[Belgrade]]. At the time [[Emerich Vogl]] was team captain.  Wetzer was brought back into the side two weeks' later for a friendly against [[Greece]] in [[Bucharest]].  This decision reaped considerable rewards for both Rădulescu and Wetzer because Wetzer scored 5 goals in an 8-1 victory for his team. Romania had been grouped with [[Uruguay]] and [[Peru]] in the tournament, defeating the Peruvians 3-1 before losing to the eventual winners and hosts 4-0. The second of these games was held at the [[Estadio Centenario]] in [[Montevideo]].

Wetzer was a very prolific scorer for [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. He and [[Gyula Bodola|Bodola]] were the top two goalscorers of the [[Balkan Cup 1929-31|1929-1931]] (first) edition of the [[Balkan Cup]] (which [[Romania national football team|Romania]] won). They scored 7 goals each for their country in that tournament alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSSF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/balkancup29.html|title=Balkan Cup (for Nations) 1929/31|publisher=RSSSF|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total Wetzer was to play 17 times for Romania scoring 13 goals.

==Coaching career==
After retiring as a footballer Wetzer became a trainer. In 1958, during a purge by the ruling national party against &quot;revisionism and bourgeois ideology, indiscipline and descriptive anarchic elements&quot; Wetzer became subject to an order forbidding him from &quot;leaving the collective in which he was engaged without good reason, under penalty of being expelled from the trainers' corps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/48-7-176.shtml Wave Of Purges In Every Field Of Rumanian Public Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Wood turned professional with the [[Brooklyn Wanderers]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]].

'''Aleksandar &quot;Tirke&quot; Tirnanić''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Александар Тирке Тирнанић; 15 July 1910 – 13 December 1992) was a [[Serbia]]n [[football (soccer)]] player and manager.

==Early life and beginnings==
Born in the central Serbian village of [[Krnjevo]], Tirnanić was still in infancy when his working-class family moved to the capital Belgrade. He barely remembered his father, a metal factory worker who died in 1914 as part of Royal Serbian Army [[World War I]] effort.

Raised by a single mother, young Tirnanić quickly developed a love for football, which he played endlessly at [[Bara Venecija]] pitches on the [[Sava River]]'s right bank. He got spotted there by coach Radenko Mitrović who brought the talented youngster to [[SK Jugoslavija]] youth setup. However, Tirnanić soon moved to arch crosstown rival [[BSK Beograd|BSK]] youth squad where he quickly developed into a notable right winger. Realizing his potential, he completely immersed himself in football and abandoned school.

==Career==
He made his first team senior debut as a 17-year-old, quickly marking himself out as an able and temperamental player, and forming a midfield partnership with [[Blagoje Marjanović|Moša Marjanović]].

Tirnanić spent most of his senior club career with [[BSK Beograd]] for which he appeared in 500 matches. During his career with BSK Tirnanić had great rivals [[Leo Lemešić]] (1924-1940) and [[Ljubo Benčić]] (1921-1935) who played for [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]. Additionally, he earned 50 caps and scored 12 goals for the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Kingdom of Yugoslavia national team]] from 1929 to 1940. In 1937 he moved to [[FK BASK|BASK]]&lt;ref&gt;Beogradski sokolovi page 76&lt;/ref&gt; where he played until 1941 when he joined [[Jedinstvo Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;Beogradski sokolovi page 87&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined another club in the [[Serbian Football League (1940–1944)|Serbian League]], Belgrade based Sloga.&lt;ref&gt;Beogradski sokolovi page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
He also appearing in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. The day before he turned 20 he scored a goal, which made him at the time the youngest goalscorer in the World Cup. Later he has been beaten by [[Manuel Rosas]] in 1930, [[Pelé]] in 1958, [[Michael Owen]] in 1998, [[Dmitri Sychev]] in 2002 and latest [[Lionel Messi]] in 2006, which makes him the sixth youngest goalscorer in the [[FIFA World Cup]]. Later, he coached the Yugoslav team in two more World Cups, [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] and [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], the football tournaments at the Summer Olympics, [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948]], [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] and [[Football at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]] when Yugoslavia won gold medal, also appearing in the [[1960 European Nations' Cup]] when Yugoslavia scored second place. 

During the [[Balkan Cup 1934-35|Balkan Cup]], held in 1935 in Athens, Greece, Tirnanić and [[Aleksandar Tomašević|Tomašević]] were the top goalscorers of the tournament with 3 goals each. Thanks to these contributions Yugoslavia won the Balkan Cup in that edition, leaving behind Greece, Romania, and Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSSF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/balkancup.html#34|title=Balkan Cup (for Nations) 1934-5|publisher=RSSSF|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 film ''[[Montevideo, God Bless You!]]'' and in 2014 film ''[[See You in Montevideo]]'', Tirnanić was portrayed by actor [[Miloš Biković]].

'''Bernard Voorhoof''' (10 May 1910 – 18 February 1974) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Football (soccer)|footballer]], the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] top scorer since 1940 with 30 goals in 61 matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miscellaneous Voorhoof info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/voorhoof-intlg.html |title=Bernard Voorhoof - Goals in International Matches |work=RSSSF |accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was joined by [[Paul Van Himst]] in 1974 who needed 81 matches to score the same number of goals.

==Career==
He started his career at [[Lierse SK]] and stayed there for 21 years. With Lierse, he scored 350 goals in 529 matches and won 2 Belgian First Division Titles and a third unofficial title in the shortened 1940−41 season. He also played one season with [[R.R.F.C. Montegnée]] before retiring in 1949, age 39.   

Voorhoof played in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], being one of six known people (5 players and 1 match official) to have appeared in all three of the pre-war World Cups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miscellaneous Voorhoof info&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The other people were players [[Edmond Delfour]], [[Étienne Mattler]], [[Nicolae Kovács]] and [[Rodolpho Barteczko|Patesko]], and referee [[Jean Langenus]], according to official FIFA match reports. Patesko, however, is not listed in many sources as part of the 1930 Brazilian squad, shortening the list to four players.&lt;/ref&gt; At the World Cup held in Italy, Voorhoof scored twice in Belgium's 2−5 defeat to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] on 27 May 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/italy1934/matches/round=204/match=1108/index.html |title=Germany - Belgium 5:2 |work=FIFA |accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jimmy Gallagher''' (June 7, 1901 in [[Kirkintilloch]], [[Scotland]] – October 7, 1971 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]) was a [[Scottish American]] [[soccer]] right wing [[midfielder]] who spent eleven seasons in the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]].  He was a member of the U.S. soccer teams at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] and [[1934 FIFA World Cup]].  Gallagher was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

==Youth==
Gallagher moved to the U.S. with his mother when he was twelve, settling in [[New York City]].  When he was seventeen, he signed with [[Tebo Yacht Basin F.C.]] of the New York State League.  In 1920, Tebo lost to [[Brooklyn Robins Dry Dock]] in the third round of the [[National Challenge Cup]].  However, the team won the 1920-1921 league and league cup titles.

==Professional career==
In 1921, Gallagher, and team mate [[Albert Mitchell]], moved to [[J&amp;P Coats]] of the newly formed [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] (ASL), spending two seasons with the team.  J&amp;P Coats won the 1922-1923 league title but lost in the semifinals of the 1923 [[National Challenge Cup]] to eventual winner Paterson F.C.  In 1923, Gallagher began the 1923-1924 season with the [[Fall River Marksmen]] but moved to the [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]] after only two games.  In the summer of 1924, he moved to [[Fleisher Yarn]].  After one season, he transferred to [[Indiana Flooring]], a new team to the league which played in the [[New York City]] area.  In 1927, [[Charles Stoneham]], bought Indiana Flooring and changed the team’s name to the [[New York Nationals (ASL)|New York Nationals]].  After three season under that name, Stoneham changed it again, this time to the [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]] in 1930.  However, while still using the moniker “Nationals”, the team won both the ASL league and cup (Lewis Cup) titles.  As the Giants, the team won the 1931-1932 ASL championship.  By that time, the league was collapsing.  The Giants lasted through the spring 1932 season before folding.  It appears that at that time, Gallagher moved to the [[New York Field Club#New York Field Club II|New York Field Club]].  He then played for Malta United on Long Island through at least December 1933.  He then moved west to sign with [[Cleveland Slavia]].  He remained with them through at least 1934 as he was listed with Slavia on the 1934 World Cup roster.  At some point, he moved to Cleveland Graphite Bronze where he finished his career.

When Gallagher left the ASL to move to Cleveland, he had played a total of 346 regular and post season games.  That was third on the U.S. list until [[Chris Henderson]] passed him in 2006.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.hofmag.com/content/view/252/201/]&lt;/sup&gt;

==National and Olympic teams==
Gallagher earned five [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]].  He played in all three U.S. games at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] as the U.S. made it to the semifinals.  He also played a friendly with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] following the cup.  His last game with the national team came in the U.S. victory over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] on May 24, 1934 which qualified the U.S. for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]] finals.  He is often confused with another Jimmy Gallagher, who played for the U.S. at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam.

==Personal==
In 1937 Gallagher married Marie Coughlin.  They went on to have two daughters, Rita Gallager (Weber) and Carol Gallagher (Such).  He has 11 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren.

Gallagher was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

In his third match for the [[Romania national football team|national team]], Vogl was named the [[Captain (association football)|team captain]]. Like [[Ladislau Raffinsky]], his team-mate at [[FC Petrolul Ploiești|Juventus Bucureşti]], he scored his first and only goal for [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match before the 1930 [[FIFA World Cup]], against [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. In 1930, he was called to the [[1930 FIFA World Cup squads|Romanian squad]] which participated at the first [[FIFA World Cup]], in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/roem-players-wc.html Romania's squad for 1930 FIFA World Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; But the chairman of Astra Romana, a company where Vogl and his team-mate [[Ladislau Raffinsky]] were [[office workers]], interdicted the two players to leave their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda.ro/news/news/7000/senzational-2.html An article about Romanian players from Timişoara that played at the World Cup. The story with Vogl and his chairman is included]&lt;/ref&gt; At the intervention of Octav Luchide, the two players eventually took the [[SS Conte Verde]] ship to [[Uruguay]].

==Biography==

Born March 3, 1906 in [[Belgrade]], he was shot by nazis during World War II on 23 May 1943 in [[Jajinci]] (near Belgrade) during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zurnal&quot;/&gt;

Known for his great personality, a footballer, one of the best fullbacks in the history of Yugoslav football, he was also a [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor]] and a communist political activist during World War II.

He started playing football in the youth team of [[SK Jugoslavija]], and became a regular senior player for the club between 1922 and 1929 playing a total of 235 matches. Towards the end of his career he moved to another Belgrade club, [[FK BASK|BASK]]. Belgrade for the national team played 42 games, one fewer than the recorder, [[Moša Marjanović]]. He played the two games for the &quot;B&quot; team (1927–1928).

He wore [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national team]] jersey dress 39 times. He made his debut on October 28, 1925 against Czechoslovakia (0-7 defeat) in Prague, and last match for the national team was played on December 16, 1934 against France (2-3 defeat) in Paris. He participated in the first [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] in Montevideo and provided a brilliant match against Brazil (2-1 win).

To this day lives an unforgeatble memory of his great exhibitions in 1927 against Romania (3-0 win) in Bucharest, the same year against Czechoslovakia (1-1) in Belgrade, in 1929 against France (3-1) in Paris and in Belgrade in 1931 against Hungary (3-2) and Czechoslovakia (2-1).

In 1934 in Belgrade he graduated in the [[University of Belgrade|Faculty of Medicine]] and after completing his military service he opened office in Belgrade. At the request of friends, his last football appearance was on May 6, 1943 on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the major club from that period, [[OFK Beograd|BSK Belgrade]].

He was raised in a patriotic family, his mother Milica was the granddaughter of the legendary Serbian [[Field Marshal]], Vojvoda [[Radomir Putnik]]. Milutin Ivković was also known for his patriotism and he joined the Progressive Movement and was one of the leaders of the Action for a boycott of the Olympic Games in Berlin. On June 1938 he became the editor of &quot;Mladost&quot;, launched at the initiative of the Communist Youth League, and during the occupation, he cooperated with the [[Yugoslav Partisans|national liberation movement]]. He was persecuted and on several occasions arrested and prosecuted. On May 24, 1943 at 23:45 hours he was arrested and the next day at Jajinci he was shot for communist activities.

The [[Football Association of Serbia]] set up in 1951 a plaque in the [[Stadion JNA|JNA Stadium]] (currently, [[FK Partizan]] stadium) and a street next to the [[Red Star Stadium]] (former playground of SK Jugoslavija) bears his name.  Additionally, a monument of authory of Vladimir Jokanović, was erected in the outskirts of the same stadium and was inaugurated on May 16, 2013.

'''Adalbert Deșu''' ({{lang-hu|Béla Dezső}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈbeːlɒ ˈdɛʒøː}}; 24 March 1909 &amp;ndash; 6 June 1937) was a [[Romania]]n [[football striker]]. He was a member of [[Romania national football team]] which competed at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Uruguay]]. Deșu was also the first scorer of [[Romania national football team|Romania]] at a [[FIFA World Cup]].

==Career==

Deșu, of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gál |first =László | title = Montevideótól Johannesburgig - Érdekességek a futball vb-k világából | location = Budapest | publisher = Aposztróf | year = 2010 | isbn = 9786155056024 | page = 154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Gătaia|Gátalja]] (Gătaia) and started his football career in his hometown. After a while he moved to [[Reşiţa]], playing for two years at [[FCM Reşiţa|UDR]]. In 1929, he was called up to the [[Romania national football team]] for the first time, scoring in a friendly against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. He was also picked up for the Romanian team which competed in [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. The chairman of the club where he played, Wolfgang Auschnit, refused to pay him the salary in the period of the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda.ro/news/news/7000/senzational-2.html A story about the players from Timişoara County that played at the FIFA World Cup. The story with Deșu and his chairman is included here (Romanian language)]&lt;/ref&gt; After the World Cup, Deșu eventually left the club because of the chairman. Deșu scored Romania's first goal against [[Peru national football team|Peru]], and played his last match for the national team in the second match of that World Cup for Romania, against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. After the World Cup, he signed with Banatul Timişoara, but in 1933 he retired from football because of [[pneumonia]]. In 1937, he died of pneumonia, aged 28.

'''Branislav &quot;Bane&quot; Sekulić''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Бpaниcлaв &quot;Бaнe&quot; Ceкулић; 29 October 1906 &amp;ndash; 24 September 1968) was a [[Serbia]]n [[Association football|football]] player and football manager.

==Career==
He began playing with the youth team of [[Javor Beograd]] before moving to [[Dušanovac Beograd]].  Being only 15 he became senior and the youngest but also best player at [[Karađorđe Beograd]] where he moved from Dušanovac along his brother Dragutin. [[FK BASK|SK Soko Beograd]] brought him next but he only played with the youth team while with them.  Next he was spotted by [[SK Jugoslavija]] where he joined a generation of players such as [[Blagoje Marjanović|Marjanović]], Dragićević, Luburić and Đurić, winning with them the [[1924 Yugoslav Football Championship|1924]] and [[1925 Yugoslav Football Championship|1925]] [[Yugoslav First League|Yugoslav Championships]].  He was characterised for having an impressive physical condition and for being very offensive, great sprinter, and having great ability for a center, besides being the owner of a powerful shot.  His speciality was the volley shot which was curiously considered to be elegant and soft but very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 &quot;Večiti rivali&quot;] by Ljubomir Vukadinović, pag. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  His talent was soon spotted by foreign clubs and he moved to France and later Switzerland where he represented [[Montpellier HSC|SO Montpellier]], [[Club Français]], [[Grasshopper-Club]] and [[Urania Geneva]].  When he returned to Yugoslavia he first joined [[SK Jugoslavija]] before moving to [[SK Jedinstvo Beograd]].  His healthy way of life allowed him to become one of the Yugoslav players with longest active playing career and to play with Jedinstvo in the championship until almost his 40s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 &quot;Večiti rivali&quot;] by Ljubomir Vukadinović, pag. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

He was part of the [[Yugoslavia national football team]] that reached the semi-finals of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].

He coached [[Red Star Belgrade]], [[FC Fribourg]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-zwit-clubs.html#u&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], [[R.F.C. de Liège]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfcliege.be/historique/Pages/index/dirigeantscoachs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SC YF Juventus]].

'''Fernando Rubens Pasi Guidicelli''' – esp. in Brazil often just '''Fernando''' – (1 March 1906 in Rio de Janeiro – 28 December 1968 in Rio de Janeiro) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[association football|football]] player. He participated in the World Cup of 1930 and played for clubs in Brazil, Italy, Switzerland, France, Portugal and Spain. He also acted as player agent and instigated a number of moves of players from South America to Europe. He was known for the mariners' cap that he wore when playing.

== Career ==
[[File:Brasil - Mundial - 1930.jpg|thumb|320px|'''World Cup 1930''': ''Back:''  [[Alfredo Brilhante da Costa|Brilhante]], Fernando Giudicelli, Hermógenes, [[Nilo Murtinho Braga|Nilo]], [[Carvalho Leite]], [[Luís Gervasoni|Itália]], [[Fausto dos Santos]], Santana; ''front:'' Teóphilo, Benevenuto, Benedito, Velloso, Doca, [[Moacir Siqueira de Queirós|Russinho]], [[Preguinho]].]]
Guidicelli was born in Rio de Janeiro.  A technically gifted central midfield-player of Italian ancestry, he reportedly commenced his career about 1924 with [[America FC (RJ)|America FC]] in the north of Rio de Janeiro, then one of the top clubs of [[Carioca]] football.&lt;ref&gt;Many sources report, that Giudicelli played for America FC before joining Fluminense. However, it has not been possible to verify this using standard literature about America FC or pertinent web sites.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1927 he moved south and joined [[Fluminense FC]], for which he played 90 times until June 1931.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fluzao.info/ Estatisticas Fluminense]'' (per 15 January 2012)&lt;BR&gt;Note: these statistics include him as &quot;Giudicelli&quot;, albeit him being listed in contemporary line-ups generally as &quot;Fernando.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[FIFA World Cup 1930|World Cup 1930]] in Uruguay he debuted with the [[Brazilian national football team]] in the match lost 1–2 against [[Yugoslav national football team|Yugoslavia]]. He also played in the second match in which Brazil defeated Bolivia 4–0. His third and last match in the national side took place in August of the same year, when Brazil defeated Yugoslavia in Rio 4–1. This match was not regarded official by the Yugoslav football association.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelo Leme de Arruda: ''[http://rsssfbrasil.com/sel/brazil192332.htm Seleção Brasileira (Brazilian National Team) 1923–1932]'', [[RSSSF-Brasil]], 28 February 2009 (matches 53, 54 and 56)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between June and August 1931 he and several players from [[Botafogo FR|Botafogo FC]] such as [[Nilo Murtinho Braga|Nilo]] and [[Carvalho Leite]] re-inforced [[CR Vasco da Gama]], also from Rio, on a trip to Europe – the only second trip to Europe by a Brazilian club since the one of [[CA Paulistano]] in 1925. In twelve matches in Portugal and Spain – among others against [[FC Barcelona]], [[FC Porto]], and [[S.L. Benfica]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] in Lisbon – the team of Vasco, coached by [[Harry Welfare]], won eight times.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Costa: ''[http://arquivocentraldesumulas.blogspot.com/2010/10/excursao-do-vasco-da-gama-europa-em.html Excursão do Vasco da Gama a Europa em 1931]'', Arquivo de Súmulas, 24 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernando Giudicelli remained in Europe and chose to play as a professional in Italy – football in Rio was still amateur sport back then – for [[FC Torino]]. He could do this, as he was considered an [[oriundo]], an Italian emigrant returning home. His excellent technique found great acknowledgement, however, his lack of fighting spirit was widely criticised and put him at a disadvantage in the context of the style of football played in Italy back then. Giudicelli played from September 1931 until April 1933 for Torino. In the first season when Torino became eighth in the league, he generally was part of the standard formation, played 28 times scoring once. 1932/33 Torino finished seventh, Giudicelli playing only twelve times. After this season Torino released him.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.enciclopediadelcalcio.it/Giudicelli.html Giudicelli Ferdinando]'', enciclopediadelcalcio.it (per 15 January 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the seasons 1931/32 and 32/33 he spent some time back in Rio. There he convinced [[Démosthenes Magalhães]], his successor in the midfield of Fluminense, to join him at Torino. Démosthenes changed his name to ''Demostene Bertini'', and thus got, at least initially away, with a claim to Italian origins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mário Filho]]: ''O negro no futebol brasileiro'', 1947, p. 183. Filho used Démosthenes to demonstrate that Brazilian players rather abandoned their names than their nationality for the sake of playing professionally in Europe. See, e.g. [[Fausto dos Santos]] and [[Jaguaré Bezerra de Vasconcelos]], who for this reason renounced the continuation of a well paid stint with FC Barcelona.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the break between the next couple of seasons he was actively recruiting South American players for European engagements. Centre forward [[Attilio Bernasconi]] from [[CA All Boys]] in Buenos Aires moved on Giudicelli's initiative in 1933 to Torino.&lt;ref&gt;''Bernasconi Ginge oggi a Napoli'', [[La Stampa]], 22 August 1933, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is reported, that after this time Giudicelli had an offer to join Argentine top side [[CA River Plate]] in Buenos Aires, however at the beginning of the season 1933/34 he joined the then Swiss first division club [[Young Fellows Zürich]]&lt;ref&gt;''Giudicelli va in Svizzera'', La Stampa, 20 August 1933, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; where it is known that the ''Black Miracle'' [[Fausto dos Santos]], another participant of the 1930 World Cup and Vasco's 1931 trip to Europe, played in 1933. In the winter break he returned to Rio, reportedly attempting to recruit players for Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;''Girardengo partite per l'Argentina: Giudicelli importatore di brasiliani per in Svizzera'', La Stampa, 29 December 1933, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Giudicelli did not return to Zürich, he was rather seen playing in Rio on the side of [[Heitor Canalli]] – a 1934 World Cup participant who commenced the 1933/34 season with Torino and played there nine times, but considered the climate in northern Italy as &quot;torture&quot; – for America FC.&lt;ref&gt;''Giudicelli e Canalli giocano in un squadra brasiliana'', La Stampa, 25 March 1934, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

1934/35 Fernando Giudicelli played in Bordeaux in France, probably for [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins]]. At the end of the season he returned once more to Brazil, this time convincing goalkeeper [[Jaguaré Bezerra de Vasconcelos]] of [[SC Corinthians Paulista]] and the defender [[Marins Alves de Araújo Viana|Marins de Araújo Viana &quot;Vianinha&quot;]], probably from [[CA Paulista]] or also Corinthians, of opportunities awaiting in Italy. After their voyage across the Atlantic their first port of call was Lisbon, where they got news of the commencement of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. Therefore they decided not to continue their journey to their intended destination. However, soon they were taken on by [[Sporting CP]] where they were the first Brazilians in club history.&lt;ref&gt;''Jaguaré, ex-meta barcelonista quería ir a Italia y si e queda en Lisboa,'' [[El Mundo Deportivo]], 23 October 1935, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Giudicelli should only play two matches for the Lisbon side: one friendly and a match for the championship of Lisbon where he was sent off after discussions with the referee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumscp.com/wiki/index.php?title=Fernando Fernando]'', Wiki Sporting, 5 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Jaguaré stayed a bit longer with Sporting, winning the city championship, but then soon moved on to [[Olympique Marseille]], where he should leave a lasting impression in the club's history. Vianinha stayed, with the exception of a brief interruption, in Portugal winning national championships with Sporting and [[FC Porto]].

Fernando Giudicelli moved on to [[Real Madrid]], becoming the first Brazilian in the club's history. In December 1935 he played against [[Racing Santander]] a sole league match for the club. After this he had a falling out with coach [[Francisco Bru]], who in the consequence suspended him.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Miguel González: ''[http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/es/1202738140048/noticia/Noticia/undefined Los primeros: Giudicelli, Canario, Didí y Evaristo]'', Real Madrid, 11 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1936 he was in France amongst speculation that he might join [[Olympique Lillois]] or [[FC Antibes]]. He ended up playing for the latter club for which he played 10 [[Ligue 1|first division]] matches scoring one goal until the end of the season 1935/35, finishing twelfth out of 16.&lt;ref&gt;''Almanach du football éd. 1935/36.'' Paris 1936, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936/37 Giudicelli played another 19 matches for the ''Antibois'' in which he scored seven goals. At the beginning of that season he was joined by Vininha, who played five league matches for the club, scoring twice, before returning to Portugal. Antibes finished the season 13th.&lt;ref&gt;''Almanach du football, éd. 1936/37.'' Paris 1937, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos Antônio Dobbert de Carvalho Leite''', best known as '''''Carvalho Leite''''' (June 25, 1912 &amp;ndash; July 19, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbf.com.br/php/craques_copas.php?j=52 CBF profile]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Brazil]]ian [[football (soccer)]] player who played as a striker.

== Career ==

=== Club career ===

László Raffinsky begun his football career in 1924, playing for Unirea, a football club from [[Timişoara]]. In 1925, Raffinsky moved to CA Timişoara, and then, in 1927, at [[Chinezul Timişoara]], one of the Romania's best clubs at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chinezul Timişoara]] won the Romanian championship six times in a row, between 1922 and 1927&lt;/ref&gt; But Raffinsky's new club entered in a financial crisis, and for the first time in seven years, Chinezul lost the Romanian championship. Eventually, Raffinsky leaves Chinezul in 1929, signing with [[FC Juventus București (1924)|Juventus Bucureşti]]. In [[Divizia A 1929-30|1929-1930 season]] of [[Liga I]], Raffinsky won his first title of champion with Juventus. In 1931, he returns to Timişoara, playing for another symbol of [[interwar period]] Romanian football, [[Ripensia]]. He leaves Ripensia in 1933, after winning another Liga I - champion title, leaving [[Romania]] for playing in [[Czechoslovakia]], at [[1. FC Brno|SK Židenice]]. He returns in [[Romania]] after two years, his come-back to [[Bucharest]], where he previously played at Juventus, being linked with a move to Rapid. He played until 1940 for Rapid, winning for three times the [[Romanian Cup]]. In 1939, he was arrested, together with another three players of Rapid, [[Iuliu Baratky]], [[Ştefan Auer]] and Ioan Bogdan, because of their win in the final of the [[Romanian Cup]] against [[Venus Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.4romania.com/Sportivi-romani-in-puscarie_19128.html Sportivi romani in puscarie | news 4 romania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They were arrested at the order of Gabriel Marinescu, the [[Minister of Internal Affairs]] and the [[Prefect#Modern sub-national administration|Prefect]] of [[Bucharest]], who was also the chairman of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.4romania.com/Sportivi-romani-in-puscarie_19128.html An article about Romanian football players who were incarcerated]&lt;/ref&gt; After a huge scandal initiated by the press, the four players were released from the jail after a few days, and Gabriel Marinescu was arrested and executed in 1940. In 1940, Raffinsky retired from his playing career.

=== National Team ===

László Raffinsky won twenty caps for the [[Romania national football team]]. His first match for [[Romania national football team|Romania]] was a defeat, in 1929, against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.frf.ro/index.php?articol=195 Evidence of Raffinsky's first match at the national team]&lt;/ref&gt; At his fourth match for the national team, Raffinsky scored his first and only goal for [[Romania national football team|Romania]], against [[Greece national football team|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.frf.ro/index.php?articol=195 Evidence of Raffinsky's first goal at the national team]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he was called to the [[1930 FIFA World Cup squads|Romanian squad]] which participated at the first [[FIFA World Cup]], in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/roem-players-wc.html Romania's squad for 1930 FIFA World Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; But the chairman of Astra Romana, a company where Raffinsky and his team-mate [[Emerich Vogl]] were [[office workers]], interdicted the two players to leave their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda.ro/news/news/7000/senzational-2.html An article about Romanian players from Timişoara that played at the World Cup. The story with Raffinsky and his chairman is included]&lt;/ref&gt; At the intervention of Octav Luchide, the two players eventually took the [[SS Conte Verde]] ship to [[Uruguay]]. In Uruguay, Raffinsky played in the both matches for [[Romania national football team|Romania]], against [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/roem-players-wc.html Evidence of the two matches played by Raffinsky at the 1930 FIFA World Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; In the match against Peru, he was fouled by Plácido Galindo of [[Peru national football team|Peru]], who was dismissed for the foul, being the first player ever to be dismissed at the [[FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport365.ro/Romania_la_primul_Mondial__III_-n15258.html The story of Romania's first match at the World Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also included in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] Best Eleven.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mihai Ionescu, Mircea Tudoran, ''Fotbal de la A la Z'', Bucharest: Editura Sport-Turism, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Raffinsky was not called up again at the national team until 1932, when he played in a 6-3 victory of [[Romania national football team|Romania]] against [[France national football team|France]]. After another three consecutive matches against [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], Raffinsky was not called up until 1937. In 1938, he was called again at a [[FIFA World Cup]], playing for [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the two matches against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. These two matches were the last matches at the national team for Raffinsky.

'''Đorđe &quot;Đokica&quot; Vujadinović''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Ђорђе Вујадиновић; 29 November 1909 – 5 October 1990) was a [[Serbia]]n international [[Association football|football]] player and manager.

==Career==
He was born in Kolari, a suburb of [[Smederevo]], but still very young, came to [[Belgrade]] to live with his uncle. While playing football with his friends in a sandy field in the [[Kalemegdan|Kalemegdan park]] in the center of the city, he was spotted by a &quot;older serious man with hat&quot; who invite him, together with other two boys, to come and make tests in, the biggest club from that period, [[BSK Belgrade|BSK]]. He passed, and joined the youth team, in which played a wonderful generation of players, in which Tirnanić, Valjarević, Krčevinac, Zloković and him make the forward line, that will be, some years later, the attack of the BSK team that won many Championships in the 1930s. Those late 1920s were years of great expansion in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Kingdom]] and football was starting to be extremely popular. In those times, the players started to be professionalized and started to be paid monetarily, but he refused, saying that his earnings as a bank employee were enough for him and that he played football only by pleasure. This is a great example of his calm and honest character. Until 1940 he played around 400 matches for the club, was national Champion five times and twice a league top-scorer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/cgi-bin/index.pl?strana=igraci&amp;strana=Vujadinovic_Djordje Career story from a text in a Mile Kos book &quot;Asovi veka&quot;, in translation:&quot;The football aces of the century&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the only BSK player to win all five national titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=167 Curiosities] from ofkbeograd.net&lt;/ref&gt;

==National team==
Before the WWII, the Yugoslav team was unimaginable without him in the squad. Between 1929 and 1940 he played 44 international matches, and didn't play more because of his duties as a bank functioner. He was one of the main players of the [[Yugoslavia national football team]] in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], and scored a total of 18 goals for the national team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/cgi-bin/index.pl?str=igraci&amp;strana=Vujadinovic Djordje]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==

===Club===
*'''BSK Belgrade'''
**5 times [[Yugoslav First League]] Champion: [[Yugoslav First League 1930-31|1930–31]], [[Yugoslav First League 1932-33|1932–1933]], [[Yugoslav First League 1934-35|1934–35]], [[Yugoslav First League 1935-36|1935–36]] and [[Yugoslav First League 1938-39|1938–39]]

===National team===
*'''Yugoslavia'''
**Semi-finalist in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]

==Trivia==
He was nicknamed &quot;Leteći fudbaler&quot;, translated to English &quot;The flying footballer&quot;. This nickname was because during the last years he played with BSK he also worked as an employee in the National Bank of Yugoslavia, so as his work did not allowed him to numerous absences, when the club played away he did not travelled earlier with the rest of the team, but he rather departed from Belgrade in last moments by airplane in order to come in time to the match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 &quot;Večiti rivali&quot;] by Ljubomir Vukadinović, pag. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcel Pinel''' (born 8 July 1908 in [[Honfleur]] ([[Calvados (département)|Calvados]]) and died 18 March 1968) was a [[French people|French]] [[Association football|footballer]].

== Biography ==
Pinel started at the club in his home town, [[Honfleur|CS Honfleur]],&lt;ref name=Honfleur&gt;[http://www.csh.fr.st/ Site of CS Honfleur]&lt;/ref&gt; and after being transferred to [[Paris université club]] and [[Stade français (football)|Stade français]], in [[1925 in football (soccer)|1925]], he joined [[Red Star Saint-Ouen|Red Star Olympique]] where he played [[Forward (association football)|centre-forward]] and [[midfield|centre-half]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://membres.lycos.fr/redstar93/Frame_1.htm Page on the site membres.lycos.fr/redstar93]&lt;/ref&gt; 

At this time, he played for [[France national football team|France]] 7 times (1930) and scored 4 goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/historique_new.php?cherche_joueur=Pinel&amp;submit=go Player page on the site of the FFF]&lt;/ref&gt; These four goals were scored against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in two games ([[Belgium-France in football|two doubles]]).

His first cap came against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which resulted in a defeat (2-3), but this match is not recognised by the French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/match_detail.php?nomatch=10001 on the site of the FFF]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore his first official selection came against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] (2-3) in [[Colombes]].

He took part in the first [[football World Cup]], in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], in [[Uruguay]], after having asked for exceptional permission to do his military service in Douanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinel.org/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=42 Pinel.org]&lt;/ref&gt; With his former teammate at Red Star, [[Augustin Chantrel]], the other intellectual in the France team, he was correspondent for the sporting newspaper ''[[L'Auto]]'' to cover the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturesfrance.com/adpf-publi/folio/foot/foot22.html culturesfrance.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In [[1932 in football (soccer)|1932]], French football became officially professional, and he played in the first national championship. Relegated to Division 2, the audoniens won their championship the following season, and returned to the top flight. Marcel Pinel played until [[1935 in football (soccer)|1935]] at Red Star.
 
A stadium is named after him in his home town of Honfleur.&lt;ref name=Honfleur/&gt;

'''Milovan Jakšić''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Mилoвaн Jaкшић) (September 21, 1909, in [[Kolašin]], [[Principality of Montenegro]]&amp;ndash;December 25, 1953 in [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]], [[Egypt]]) was a Montenegrin [[Association football|football]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].

Remembered mostly as '''&quot;El Grande Milovan&quot;''', the nickname he earned for his excellent saves in the game that Yugoslavia won against Brasil in the First World Cup in Uruguay [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. He is considered as one of the major contributors for Yugoslavia reaching the semi-finals in that tournament.

Being of medium stature, but very strong physically, Milovan's main characteristics were his bravure and excellent reflexes. Milovan spent most of his career playing in [[BASK Belgrade]], named SK Soko before 1931, where he played until 1939. The only exceptions were the Czechoslovak [[SK Slavia Praha]], where Milovan Jaksic played a few months of the 1934-35 season, and SK Ljubljana at the end of his career.

Milovan Jaksic played a total of nine matches for the [[Yugoslavia national football team]]. His debut was on April 13, 1930, in a friendly game against Bulgaria in Belgrade, a 6-1 win, and his fairway match was on September 2, 1934, in another friendly game, this time in Prague, against Czechoslovakia, a 3-1 loss. Despite all the competition that he faced for the national team goalkeeping place, Milovan Jaksic was selected to be the main goalkeeper at the 1930 World Cup. Having displayed magnificent exhibitions in all the matches at the tournament, it is specially remembered by his contributions in the match against Brazil, and it was after that match, that the delighted journalists started calling him by his new nickname: &quot;El Grande Milovan&quot;.

After retiring, Milovan Jaksic stayed connected to football. After the World War II, in March 1945, Milovan Jaksic established [[Red Star Belgrade]] football club, and was the club's Technical Director. Milovan Jaksic was also the President of the Football Coaching Federation of Yugoslavia, from 1950 until the winter of 1953, when he died unexpectedly of a heart-attack during the football tournament in [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]], [[Egypt]], where he accompanied [[Red Star Belgrade]].

Playing as a [[Defender (association football)|left-back]], he was known for his classy, elegant style, correctness and excellent positioning in the field.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

He started playing in the youth teams of Belgrade's [[SK Jugoslavija]], where he played most of his career, from 1929 until 1935, making with [[Milutin Ivković]], considered by many as the best full-back of the pre-1941 Yugoslav football,{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} one of the best defences. He played for the club in 110 official matches.

He played twice for the [[Yugoslavia national football team]]. His début was on May 6, 1928, in Belgrade against Romania, a 3–1 win, and his other, and last, match was on August 3, 1930, in a friendly in Buenos Aires against Argentina, a 1–3 loss, just after the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], in which he was part of the team, but didn't play any match. Despite having been a remarkable player,{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} the competition in the defence didn't allow him to have more caps for the national team.

After retiring, he enrolled the [[Belgrade Law School]] and has earned a degree. He died in winter of 1970, at 61 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1512&amp;Itemid=12 Profile at Reprezentacija.rs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed &quot;Srbenda&quot;, he was known as a great, cleaver and effective [[Forward (association football)|striker]]. Anecdotally, his killer instinct was specially awake every time he played against [[BSK Belgrade]], the best pre-war Serbian club, having scored at least once in every match he played against them. He was specially dangerous because he had the ability to shoot and surprise the goalkeepers from any angle.

He spend most of his career with [[FK Vojvodina]] where he played for 14 years, between 1921 until 1935 being one of their most influential players of the pre-war period. Afterward, he had short spells with [[BSK Belgrade]] and French club [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]].

He was part of the [[Yugoslavia national football team]] for some period, but he only played one match, as a substitute of the famous striker [[Blagoje Marjanović]] in a friendly match played on October 9, 1932, in Prague, against Czechoslovakia, a 2-1 win. He was part of the Yugoslav team at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], but didn't play any match.

After retiring, he continue linked to football as a manager, having coached several clubs in Yugoslavia and Tunisia.

He unexpectedly died in 1974, in the aftermath of a prostate surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1268&amp;Itemid=12 Profile and career story at Reprezentacija.rs]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Eisenbeisser''' ({{lang-ro|Alfred &quot;Fredi&quot; Fieraru}}) (born 7 April 1908 in [[Cernăuţi]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now in [[Ukraine]]) - deceased 1 July 1991 in Berlin, Germany) was a [[Romania]]n [[Association football|football player]] and [[figure skater]] of [[Germans|German]] ethnicity. As a footballer, he played for [[Romania national football team|Romania]] at [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] *[http://de.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/results/matches/match=1098/report.html], while as a figure skater he participated at the [[1936 Winter Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport365.ro/Jocurile_Olimpice_de_iarna___Garmisch_Partenkirchen_1936-n114638.html An article about 1936 Winter Olympic Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Football ===

Alfred Eisenbeisser started his career at Jahn Cernăuţi. In 1930, he joined another team from [[Cernăuţi]], Dragoş Vodă, and shortly after he was selected in the [[Romania national football team|Romania squad]] for the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]]. He made his debut for the [[Romania national football team]] at the tournament, playing in the two matches against [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educat.ro/biblioteca/sport/rudy.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the trip back to [[Romania]], he nearly died because of [[pneumonia]], after having a bath with cold water. When the ship arrived to [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], he was interned in a [[hospital|sanatory]]. The Romanian staff called also a priest to make a [[Eucharist]] [[Church service|service]], because his condition was critical.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai Ionescu, Mircea Tudoran, ''Un secol de fotbal românesc'', Bucharest: Editura Sport-Turism, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Romanian players returned in the country, they announced Alfred's death. Fortunately, he recovered and returned home, exactly when his mother was preparing the funeral repast. She fainted when she saw her son alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educat.ro/biblioteca/sport/rudy.php The story of Eisenbeisser and his mother is told here]&lt;/ref&gt;

After playing two years for Dragoş Vodă Cernăuţi, he moved to [[Venus Bucureşti]]. He made his debut in October 1932, against CA Oradea. In his second of the ten seasons spent as a Venus player, he won his first Divizia A champion title. He won another two championships in 1937 and 1939.

He retired from his footballing career in 1944.

=== Figure skating ===

Alfred was also a successful figure skater. At the 1934 [[European Figure Skating Championships]], he and his partner Irina Timcic finished seventh in the mixed pair events.

Again with Irina Timcic, he took part at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]], finishing 13th. His last major figure skating competition was the mixed pair event at the 1939 European Championships, when he and his partner Ileana Moldovan finished 9th.

== Achievements ==

=== Football ===

* Champion of Romania (three times) : [[Divizia A 1933-34|1933-34]], [[Divizia A 1936-37|1936-37]], [[Divizia A 1938-39|1938-39]]

'''Natalio Perinetti''' (December 28, 1900 – May 24, 1985) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Association football|football]] [[Forward (association football)|forward]] that spent most of his career in [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]], playing for 17 years and winning 12 titles with the ''Academia''.

==Biography==
Perinetti started playing football matches with his friends in the district of [[Barracas, Buenos Aires|Barracas]], his birthplace. Due to his skills with the ball, he was encouraged to try registering with a club with the hope of developing a career in football.

His first club was [[Talleres de Remedios de Escalada|Talleres (BA)]] where he played with the youth teams. Perinetti came to Racing in 1915, after being recommended by his older brother Juan. He started at the fourth division playing as [[association football positions#Winger|right winger]]. It was during those years when he met [[Pedro Ochoa]] (other skilled player who would be later nicknamed ''the king of the dribbling''), who became Perinetti's partner inside the field and best friend in life.

Perinetti debuted with the senior team two years later. He soon noted as a key player for Racing, being praised and recognised for his speed and control of the ball. He played 17 consecutive years in Racing, winning 12 titles with the club (10 domestic and 2 international).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingclub.com.ar/idolos/natalio-perinetti/ &quot;Idolos: Natalio Perinetti&quot; on Racing website]&lt;/ref&gt; During his brilliant career in Racing, then president of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Santiago Bernabéu Yeste|Santiago Bernabeu]], tried to convince him to play for the club, but he refused the offer because of his love for Racing.&lt;ref name=ar/&gt;

Perinetti was part of the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national tema]] where he played 7 games between 1923 and 1930, including the first [[FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Uruguay]] in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]. He also played the [[1929 South American Championship]] (current [[Copa América]]) with the national squad.&lt;ref name=ar&gt;[http://ar.noticias.com/deportes/historia-de-natalio-perinetti-el-fantasma-que-aparece-en-los-estadios.html &quot;Historia de Natalio Perinetti&quot; on Noticias Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Perinetti was traded to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] but he only played a bunch of games there, retiring from football soon after.

==Honours==
All of them won with Racing Club:

===National===
* [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División]] (5): 1917, 1918, 1919, 1921, 1925
* [[Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires]] (1): 1917

====South American Championship====
Andrade played in South American Championship (now known as [[Copa América]]) winning teams in 1923, 1924 and 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/23safull.html|title=Southamerican Championship 1923|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/24safull.html|title=Southamerican Championship 1924|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/26safull.html|title=Southamerican Championship 1926|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1924 Olympics====
Andrade won his first [[Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympic football tournament]] in [[Paris]]. He was recognised as being the first black international football player to play Olympic football.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Findling|first=John E. |author2=Pelle, Kimberly D. |title=Encyclopedia of the modern Olympic movement|page=84|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|isbn=0-313-32278-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nicknamed ''The Black Marvel'' and ''The Black Pearl'', the latter a name later used in reference to [[Pelé]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197020/overview.html|title=Tournaments - Paris, 1924 |publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the 1924 Olympic win the Uruguayan team were challenged to a two match series by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. In the second match at the [[Estadio Sportivo Barracas]] in [[Buenos Aires]] Andrade was pelted with stones by the Argentine crowd to which Andrade and the rest of the Uruguayan team responded by throwing the stones back. In the ensuing riot a member of his team was arrested and the Uruguayans refused to play out the remainder of the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;ballround1&quot; /&gt;

====1928 Olympics====
In 1928 he won his second Olympic gold medal at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics]] in Amsterdam. During the semi-final match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] Andrade collided with a goal post, seriously injuring an eye. This later deteriorated to the point that he became blind in that eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;conti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conti-online.com/generator/www/uk/en/contisoccerworld/themes/02_fanzone/04_stars/1930-andrade-en.html|title=FIFA World Cup Star 1930: Jose Leandro Andrade|work=ContiSoccerWorld|publisher=Continental|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930 FIFA World Cup====
Despite not being at his peak he managed to be one of Uruguay's best players as they won the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]]. At the end of the tournament he was selected in the All-Star team.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfl1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-football-legends.co.uk/andrade.php|title=JOSÉ ANDRADE|publisher=World Football Legends|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=45617/index.html|title=FIFA Player Statistics: Jose Andrade|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sr1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jose-leandro-andrade-1.html|title=José Leandro Andrade|publisher=Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he was selected by [[France Football]] as number ten in their World Cup Top-100.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/ff-wc100.html|title=France Football's World Cup Top-100 1930–1990|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A plaque was placed at the [[Estadio Centenario]] in honour of his achievements.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Bill|author2=Murray, William J|title=The world's game: a history of soccer|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1998|isbn=0-252-06718-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
Andrade was also credited with being an intelligent and honest player who never celebrated his goals. He was a dynamic, fast and highly technical player who was able to dominate the pitch without the physicality of many of his team mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;gumbrecht1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;conti&quot; /&gt;

==Later life==
Andrade was a guest at the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] when Uruguay won their second world championship. His nephew [[Víctor Rodríguez Andrade]], a member of the 1950 team, had adopted Andrade as his [[Spanish naming customs|second surname]] in honour of Andrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;conti&quot; /&gt; 

By 1956, when he was located by German journalist Fritz Hack, he had descended into [[alcoholism]] and was living in a small flat in a poor area of Montevideo.&lt;ref name=&quot;conti&quot; /&gt;

After contracting [[tuberculosis]] Andrade died in poverty in 1957 at the Piñeyro del Campo nursing home in Montevideo.&lt;ref name=&quot;galeano1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;conti&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/book-football-in-sunshine-and-shadow-by-eduardo-galeano-fourth-estate-pounds-999-1288958.html|title=Book: Football in Sunshine And Shadow by Eduardo Galeano|last=Davies|first=Pete|date=15 December 1997|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartholomew &quot;Bertie&quot; or &quot;Bart&quot; McGhee''' (April 30, 1899 in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] – January 26, 1979 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]) was an American [[soccer]] [[Striker (association football)|forward]] who typically played left wing forward. He played for the [[United States men's national soccer team]] at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], and scored the second goal in World Cup history against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. He was inducted into the U.S. [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

==Youth==
McGhee was the son of former [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] player and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] manager [[James McGhee]], and the brother of [[Philadelphia Field Club]] forward [[Jimmy McGhee]].  McGhee's father was a renowned Scottish player who appeared with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in an 1886 game with [[Wales national football team|Wales]].  McGhee's father had a controversial term as the manager of Hearts.  When he finally resigned on December 6, 1909, he began assessing his options.  In September 1910 he decided to leave Scotland and emigrate to the United States.  It took Jimmy McGhee two years to get settled and it was not until 1912 that McGhee, his mother and younger brother Jimmy joined his father in the U.S.  When they arrived in the U.S., the family settled in [[Philadelphia]].

==Playing==

===Amateur===
When he was nineteen, McGhee  began playing for [[New York Shipbuilding]], located in [[Camden, New Jersey]], of the South Jersey League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20091028130522 |url=http://geocities.com/bethlehem_soccer/gl022518.html |title=February 25, 1918 ''The Globe'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next season, he moved to Wolfenden Shore, of the Allied American Football Association; playing with them until at least March 1921 when he was on trial with [[Bethlehem Steel F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20091028130151 |url=http://geocities.com/bethlehem_soccer/gl033121.html |title=March 31, 1921 ''The Globe''}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to [[Philadelphia Hibernian]] of the National Soccer League of Philadelphia. He played with them from 1921 to 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20091028125838 |url=http://geocities.com/bethlehem_soccer/gl010122.html |title=January 2, 1922 ''The Globe'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional===
In 1922, McGhee signed with the [[New York Field Club]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921–1933)|American Soccer League]].   He spent two seasons with New York before moving to [[Fleisher Yarn]] in 1924.  Fleisher had existed for years as an amateur powerhouse, but in 1924 the team went professional.  It was unable to maintain itself as a professional team and folded at the end of the season.  When Fleisher failed, McGhee moved to [[Indiana Flooring]] which played in New York City.  McGhee spent two seasons with Indiana.  In 1927, [[Charles Stoneham]], owner of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] [[baseball]] team, bought Indiana Flooring.  He renamed the team the [[New York Nationals (ASL)|New York Nationals]].  To make matters even more confusing, Stoneham renamed the team again, in 1932.  That year the original [[New York Giants (soccer)|New York Giants]] ASL club folded.  Stoneham acquired the rights to the name and used it for his club.  McGhee played with this team, under all its names, through 1932, except for a loan period to [[Philadelphia Field Club]] during the 1928–1929 season.

In 1928, the New York Nationals won the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|National Challenge Cup]].  In 1929, the club then won the Lewis Cup, the ASL cup competition.  Under the new name, New York Giants, the club also won the 1930–1931 ASL championship.

After 1929 ASL statistics become patchy as the [[Great Depression]] and the ASL/FIFA Soccer Wars took a toll on the league.  Despite this, McGhee played at least 350 games and scored 137 goals from 1921–1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/asl1leaders.html Top scorers in U.S. soccer history.]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]], &quot;There are also reports in some publications that he later played in England for Hull City. However, he ''[sic]'' son Ed, who lives in Riverton, New Jersey, told me that, apart from his trip to South America, Bart never left the U.S.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://national.soccerhall.org/Spotlight%20HallofFamer/BartMcGhee_spotlight.htm National Hall of Fame spotlight on McGhee]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National team===
McGhee earned three [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[USMNT|U.S. national team]], all coming in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].   He scored the first goal for a U.S. team in World  Cup competition in the opening victory over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].

In 1986, the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] inducted McGhee.
During his ASL career Bart McGhee played in 350 league games and scored 127 goals, almost all of them from the left wing position. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame posthumously in 1986.

'''Blagoje &quot;Moša&quot; Marjanović''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Благоје Марјановић Моша; September 9, 1907 – October 1, 1984) was a [[Serbia]]n [[football (soccer)]] player and manager.

==Career==
Born to merchant father Dimitrije and housewife mother Sofija, young Blagoje grew up on the outskirts of Belgrade in 7 Đakovačka Street.

Blagoje Marjanović was one of the best [[association football|football]] [[Striker (association football)|forward]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. He played for [[OFK Beograd|BSK]] (1926–39), with whom he won four league titles (1931st, 1933rd, 1935th, 1936) and three times was the best league goal scorer (1930th, 1935th, 1937). For the national team debut on 28 June 1926 in a friendly match against [[Czechoslovakia]] (2-6) in [[Zagreb]]. For the first time in the list of shooters entered on May 15, 1927 against [[Bulgaria]] in [[Sofia]] when in the last five minutes scoring only two goals in the match. During his career, he scored 36 goals in 57 games for national team (unbroken record, until [[Stjepan Bobek|Bobek]] came, and scored 38 goals in 63 games, although Marjanović has better scoring ratio at 0,63 goals per game), and 575 goals in 14 seasons for his club BSK. He participated in the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]] in [[Amsterdam]] and the first [[FIFA World Cup 1930]] in [[Uruguay]]. He has won bronze medal in [[FIFA World Cup 1930]] in [[Uruguay]]. He scored one goal in that tournament in the game versus [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Reportaza/172669/Kada-su-fudbaleri-primili-prve-plate Kada su fudbaleri primili prve plate]; ''Blic'', January 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from 1930 World Cup, this excellent striker became (alongside his teammate [[Aleksandar Tirnanić|Tirnanić]]), first professional footballer in Yugoslavia (although he had a little bit higher salary then Tirnanić). For his services at [[BSK Beograd|BSK]] Marjanović was paid [[Yugoslav dinar|YUS]]1,800 per month. The exchange rate of dinar against US dollar in December 1930 was $1 = YUS56.39 meaning that his monthly salary was $32 (about $446 in 2014 dollar).{{Ref|1}}He and Tirnanić formed one of the greatest right side partnership in Yugoslavian football history. Although, during the match he understood with Tirnanić very well, he had almost the same understanding with other teammates, from his club and from national team. Marjanović was highly intelligent player, and he was able to realize, how every of his teammates plays. During the game it always seemed that he knew what to do with or without a ball (especially during goalscoring situations in opponent penalty box, when he was highly unpredictable and very clever). He was very accurate shooter, but with average shot power. Moša could score from almost every position (he scored quite a few goals with his back-heel, chests and sometimes even stomach) and he didn't care if the ball came low or high, because he was, also, very good in air game. His main specialty was volley shot. Besides that, he was also one of the best free-kick takers in Yugoslavia. He scored a few times hat-trick for national team, but probably most memorable was against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 1934, in friendly game in Belgrade (the score was 8:4 for Yugoslavia). Many football experts of that time showed great appreciation for &quot;Moša's&quot; skills, including [[Hugo Meisl]] (creator and coach of the Austrian &quot;[[Wunderteam]]&quot;) who claimed that with Marjanović in the attacking line &quot;Wunderteam&quot; would be perfect.

Marjanovic enjoyed great fame. He was a national superstar but also a playboy, up to the moment when his club played against [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk]], in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. On the eve of the match, he met a Dalmatian girl who supported Hajduk. They were married in 1938 with great interest of the public and journalists. The last match for the national team was played on April 3, 1938 against [[Poland]] in a World Cup qualifier. Marjanović scored the only goal of the match. During [[WW II]], he was captured and placed in a prison camp in [[Fürstenberg/Havel|Fürstenberg]], Germany. In the midst of adversity, sometimes they organized football matches between &quot;war prisoners&quot; against the &quot;guardians&quot;. When the war ended, he returned to Yugoslavia and played for [[FK Dinamo Pančevo|Dinamo Pančevo]] (1945–48). His career ended in [[NK Osijek|Proleter]] from [[Osijek]] (1949). During his coaching career, he first led Proleter Osijek then [[OFK Beograd]], which 1953 won the national cup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=83&lt;/ref&gt;  He was later a coach in Italian league (one year in [[Torino FC|AC Torino]] and one year in [[Calcio Catania]]). He returned to Yugoslavia and became a coach for [[FK Pobeda|FK Pobeda Prilep]]. After a match in 1961, Moša suffered a [[stroke]]. He never regained his speech and the right side of his body was paralyzed. He died in 1984.

In the 2014 film ''[[See You in Montevideo]]'', Marjanović was portrayed by actor Petar Strugar. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cARFBihsR6Q Movie trailer])

[[File:Moderato Wisintainer - 1931.jpg|thumb|160px|Moderato Wisintainer - 1931]]
'''Moderato Wisintainer''', also '''Visintainer''', in line-ups generally '''Moderato''', (14 July 1902 in [[Alegrete, Brazil|Alegrete]]  ([[Rio Grande do Sul|RS]])– 31 January 1986 in [[Pelotas]] (RS)) was a Brazilian association footballer. Moderato, who played on the right wing, took part with the [[Brazilian national football team]] at the first World Cup in 1930 in Uruguay. In the 1920s he won twice the [[Campeonato Carioca|Championship of Rio de Janeiro]] with [[CR Flamengo]]. On several occasions he also played for the state teams of Rio and Rio Grande do Sul.

During his youth he played for [[Esporte Clube 14 de Julho|EC 14 de Julho]] of [[Santana do Livramento]] (RS) before joining [[Guarani Futebol Clube (Alegrete)|Guarani FC]] in his town of birth. In 1921 he moved to the newly founded club ''Palestra Itália'', today known as [[Cruzeiro EC]] in [[Belo Horizonte]], the capital of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], where he stayed until 1922.

1923 he joined [[CR Flamengo]] in the then Brazilian capital [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Until 1930 he played in 147 matches for Flamengo scoring 27 goals. In 1925 and 1927 he won with the club the [[Campeonato Carioca|Championship of Rio de Janeiro]]. In the decisive match of the 1927 competition he scored the winning goal in a 2-1 victory over [[America-RJ|America FC]], albeit being handicapped with a brace protecting a him after a recent appendix operation.

He debuted for the Brazilian national team on 6 December 1925 in a 5-2 win over Paraguay in the [[1925 South American Championship|South American Championship]] in Buenos Aires. He played three more matches for Brazil in this tournament, which finished second behind the hosts. In the first edition of the World Cup, [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 in Uruguay]] was not selected for the first match, which Brazil lost 1-2 to [[Yugoslavia]]. In the second match against Bolivia, which Brazil won 4-0, he scored two goals and he became the second player to score for Brazil in a World Cup, after [[Preguinho]] from Rio's [[Fluminense FC]]. However, Brazil did not progress to the next round of the tournament.

After the World cup he returned to his home state where he finished his football career 1932 with his original club Guarani FC in Alegrete. With Guarani he became runner-up in the [[Campeonato Gaúcho|Rio Grande do Sul State Championship]] of 1931, losing in the final 0-3 to [[Grêmio FBPA]] of the capital [[Porto Alegre]].

Afterwards Dr. Moderato Wisintainer worked as engineer in [[Pelotas]] (RS).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur de Carvalho: ''Umas e Outras de Esporte'', [[Diário da Noite (Rio de Janeiro)|Diário da Noite]], RJ, 30/07/1958, 2° seção, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also was active as functionary for [[Clube Esportivo Bento Gonçalves|Esportivo Bento Gonçalves]] and in later years became an avid golf player.&lt;ref&gt;''Fatos e Personalidades'', [[Correio da Manhã (Brazil)|Correio da Manhã]], RJ, 17/07/1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Moderato died in January 1986 aged 83 in Pelotas.

'''Rafael Garza Gutiérrez''', nicknamed &quot;'''Récord'''&quot; (13 December 1896 in [[Mexico City]]– 3 July 1974), was a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[Association football|footballer]] and [[coach (sport)|coach]]. He, along with other members of the Garza family, are recognized as the founders of [[Club América]]. He was a [[defender (soccer)|defender]] for that club as well as the [[Mexico national football team|Selección de fútbol de México]] (Mexico national team). Upon retiring, he took the [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] of his beloved club as an executive and later served as the national team manager on four separate occasions.{{CN|dated=February 2015|date=February 2015}}. He is an Olympian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ga/rafael-garza-gutierrez-1.html &lt;/ref&gt;

== Club América ==
Garza Gutiérrez, and a group of young men, championed the idea of a Club América when on 12 October 1916 (Columbus Day; Spanish, &quot;Día del descubrimiento de America&quot;/&quot;Day of the discovery of America&quot;), met. There existed Garza's &quot;Récord&quot; (which would later become his personal nickname) and Germán Nuñez's &quot;Unión&quot;; they consolidated forces. The name came from the significance of the day on which the club was established.{{CN|dated=February 2015|date=February 2015}}

Garza continued in 1917 to be a force when América was &quot;promoted&quot; to compete in ''Liga Mayor de la Ciudad'' (Major League of Mexico City). Garza led América to four consecutive championships (player in [[1924–25 Primera División de México|1924–25]]; and player/coach in [[1925–26 Primera División de México|1925–26]], [[1926–27 Primera División de México|1926–27]], [[1927–28 Primera División de México|1927–28]]). America would have its next league championship in [[1965–66 Primera División de México|1965–66]].{{CN|dated=February 2015|date=February 2015}}

== Mexico national football team ==
Garza's early success brought him to the attention of those that championed the idea of a national team to represent Mexico in international competition. This team would be governed by [[Mexican Football Federation]] ({{Lang-es|Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación}}; FEMEXFUT), when it was created in 1927. Garza was elected to be the team's first head coach, although he had been informally coaching what was then the team since 1923. He continued at his post until 1928. He played as a defender at the first [[1930 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], held in [[Uruguay]] in 1930. After his retirement as a player, he continued to coach the Mexico national team three times (1934-35, 1937 and 1949).{{CN|dated=February 2015|date=February 2015}}

==1928 Olympic Summer Games - Amsterdam==
He was on the football team sent by Mexico to compete at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics – Men's team squads#Mexico|1928 Olympic Summer Games]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ga/rafael-garza-gutierrez-1.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Alejandro Villanueva was noted to have an extraordinary handling the football, and his many outrageous moves won him the nickname &quot;[[Hose (tubing)|Manguera]].&quot; Among his many exploits, the bicycle kick was one of the moves that won him widespread recognition. While playing for [[Alianza Lima]], Villanueva's fame increased as he made international appearances such as in 1933 when [[Alianza Lima]] made a tour in [[Chile]] and, with fellow Peruvians such as [[Teodoro Fernandez]], delighted the audiences with his skill and defeated a series of important Chilean clubs of that time such as [[Club Deportivo Magallanes]], [[Santiago Wanderers]], [[Audax Italiano]], and [[Colo-Colo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubalianzalima.com/pages/hist1921.asp|title=Historia Blanquiazul: 1921–1960|accessdate=2008-08-12|work=clubalianzalima.com|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peru.com/futbol/seleccion/historia/futbolistas/tfernandez.asp|title=Teodoro 'Lolo' Fernandez|accessdate=2008-08-12|work=futbolperuano.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080811135908/http://www.peru.com/futbol/seleccion/historia/futbolistas/tfernandez.asp| archivedate= 11 August 2008 | deadurl= no|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Peru, Villanueva is often remembered as one of the finest exponents of that nation's association football and as the player that amazed the crowds with his bicycle kicks. Interestingly, the people of [[Lima]] at first thought the bicycle kick was his invention when he executed it in 1928, and commonly called it &quot;tiro caracol.&quot; Later, the name would change to &quot;chalaca&quot; when people began to favor the idea that the move was invented in Callao several decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peruan-ita.org/personaggi/dario/villanueva.htm|title=Alejandro Villanueva|accessdate=2008-08-19|work=www.peruan-ita.org| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080828054739/http://www.peruan-ita.org/personaggi/dario/villanueva.htm| archivedate= 28 August 2008 | deadurl= no|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these achievements, Villanueva remains a famous figure in Peru to the point that several songs have been made about him and his eternal club, [[Alianza Lima]].

Alianza Lima's stadium, located in the La Victoria district of Lima, is named after him.  It is also known as &quot;Manguera&quot;.
